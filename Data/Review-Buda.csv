1;Sandor;Located adjacent to Buda Castle Complex, S√°ndor Palace has served as the official residence and workspace of the President of Hungary since 2003. If you can, try to time your visit for the hourly changing of the guards. From here, you can continue to explore the Buda Castle Complex and adjacent ruins.
1;Restored part of Castle Hill;The Changing of the Guard takes place in this area.<br><br>The top of Castle Hill was pounded to rubble during World War II and the buildings you see today are mid to late 20th century restorations.
1;President place;Here is a beautiful gate with attractive architecture!its near the President place.there are many beautiful views üòçüòç
1;OK;Sandor Palace is the office of the President of Hungary. <br>The building looks nice but nothing much to do in here.
1;An elegant palace.;Nothing much to see or do here, other than watch the changing of the guard at this rather elegant palace.
1;Changing of the guard.;There really isn't much special about the palace. Actually looks like a big house. Nothing really grand about it. It was nice to see the changing of the guard though. Amazing how close you are to it all.
1;It was great to catch the change of the guard.;The palace is just a normal looking palace, nothing exceptional in contrast with the surroundings. What was really great is that we had a chance to watch the changing of the guard and this really made the visit here worthwhile.
1;Official residence of the President of Hungary from 2003. It is rarely open to the public.;Located on Castle Hill near to the top Funicular Station is this rather unassuming building that has been used as the official residence of the President of Hungary since 2003. The original building dated from 1806 and housed aristocrats and Prime Ministers. It was almost totally destroyed by bombing in WWII but was gradually rebuilt and renovated following Hungary's change to democracy in 1989.<br><br>The facade which faces the square and has two soldiers guarding its entrance, has two green doors above which sits the coat of arms of Hungary with the Hungarian and EU flags on either side.<br><br>Not a must see.
1;Sandor Palace;Sandor Palace is situated next to Buda Castle. It is where the Hungarian President lives and has 2 guards outside. The funicular is next to it. You cannot go inside.
1;Hungary‚Äôs Presidential Residence;The Sandor Palace is the official residence and headquarters of the president of Hungary. It was, as with all other buildings in Budapest, destroyed in the world war 2. Originally built in 1806 in the neoclassical style, Sandor Palace is housed inside Buda castle. You can see the guards change(not as lavish as the Buckingham places guards change in London, but I like the simplicity!) every hour up until 5pm with a little pomp of marching and drum rolls and rifle displays. <br><br>The views of neighbouring parliament and chain bridge as well as St Stephen‚Äôs Basilica are grand. There‚Äôs no entry fees to the castle unless you wish to visit the museums. If you have a bit of time hang around for the sunset as I must say the views are extraordinarily! <br><br>
1;we did see changing the guards;its a beautiful plain building<br>but we got a bonus when we was there<br>we watch the changing of the guards<br>very interesting<br>we could not visit it inside
1;Hungarian Presidential Palace next to Buda Castle;This is the residence of the President and is located at the top next to Buda Castle where the funicular is located.  You will see there are always military soldiers guarding the palace and you are welcome to take photographs, but you won't be able to get access inside the palace.<br><br>As a building on its own, it is interesting but not very eye-catching - though if you happen to see the official changing of the guards ceremony (which I didn't :(  sadly), then it is well worth it and probably deserves an extra star.  Here are the ceremony details:<br><br>*  Monday to Sunday: 9am ‚Äì 5pm on the hour (eg 10am, 11am, etc).<br><br>*  Special Saturdays: once a month on the last Saturday of the month, the changing of the guards is accompanied by music. The Special Saturday Changing of the Guards is at 12pm.
2;The visitors feel cheated;We went to the library near National Museum on Saturday, 15 April 2023. The ticket cost 1700 forints and not the 1000 forints mentioned by others. None of the pictures we see on the net could be seen in any of the places. Large areas of the library were locked away. No one though we made it clear that we were here to see the images on the net, we were very quiet, but nobody guides us to any of those areas and we feel very cheated. <br>We are quiet sure we didn't miss them. Half the building was locked away and  we feel cheated because we paid quite a significant sum and we did not see any of the areas that the library talks about. <br><br>There were not even any signs up in English pointing to the historical nature of the building and how it has been built. That's up on the net but no details were there inside the building. this is a cheat on the tourists. Of course one must maintain the decorum of the library and we did. But the tourists should get to see what they paid for. The Municipality owes us an explanation on why we were cheated. We would like our money returned and we would like a proper visit where we get to see what we came to see.
2;Probably the most beautiful library in the world;I'm really pleased that I managed to visit this spectacular library. Finding the building was easy with Google map from Kalvin ter. The entrance is to the left of the building ( facing the front). As you enter, go through the double door to reach the actual foyer.  Go to the ladies sitting to the right where you can see the sign of Visa/MC for paying. It was 1800 HUF. The lady was not particularly welcoming but neither was she mean. I asked her for a tourist ticket, she asked me "the palace?" I said yes and paid. She even gave me a leaflet in English. <br>Go to the turnstiles where someone would lift the red rope to let you enter. Your ticket will not work at the turnstile. On the way out just push the bars to come out. Look for signs of the lift and go straight to 4th Floor. Come out of the lift, turn right, go through a white modern room and immediately you'll see the beautifully ornate rooms. It was slightly surreal to see young pupils working on their laptops under massive chandeliers. <br>Felt awkward to take photos but I guess students are used to tourists. Keep the camera silent. Visit all rooms. The room with staircase is really nice. The map identifies the rooms. There is some info on the original family as well. I suggest an hour to take it slowly. <br>You can have a drink at the cafe on the ground floor. <br>Probably the most beautiful library I have ever seen.
2;Beautiful reading rooms;Costs about ¬£3 per person to enter, to look at the stunning reading rooms.  You obviously have to be super quiet and unobtrusive as people are still using the rooms for research and study.  Main negative was that the women at the front desk who sold us the tickets was very miserable and pretty rude, which was a shame.  The guy opening the gate to let you out again was nice though.
2;Impressive "royal reading rooms";The impressively decorated old palace rooms now serve as reading / study rooms for students. Each room is dedicated to another faculty. While the students quietly sit and study, we could wander through the rooms.
2;AMAZING hidden gem;I went with a tour group,  but it is available for individual visitors.  There is a small fee, but it is WELL worth it.  This is a beautiful building (palace) that has been transformed into a library - and a very popular one!!  The children's library is worth seeing, especially the dragon courtyard and the reading pit.  But the top floor is the most beautiful part.  You need to stay quiet, because these rooms are all used by university students to study in - but you can wander through the room gawking and taking photos.
2;WOW!;I was super excited to visit this library based on the photos I saw online.  However, once I got there I waited 10 mins outside before I got the courage to go in.  The reviews weren‚Äôt clear on access requirements and I didn‚Äôt want to be the stereotypical stupid American haha.<br><br>I entered via Reviczky u through 3 pairs of doors before you get to the information desk - wooden doors, glass sliding doors, wooden doors.  The lady at the desk spoke little English but she understood me enough to know why I was there.  The cost to enter is 1000 HUF, or approximately $3.31.  <br><br>Once you pay the fee, you have to go through security turnstiles.  Since I didn‚Äôt have a card, I had to ask a couple of ladies at the information desk (closest to the turnstiles) how to go in.  One of them took me through the red rope.  I think normally I would have had to deposit my things in the locker room but it was close to 7pm and they closed at 8pm. <br><br>Anyway, I quickly headed to the 4th floor soon after.  After stepping off the elevator, head to your left.  The old smoking room is in the very back. there are signs indicating ‚ÄúPalace‚Äù.  Before I got there, I passed the reading room which was breathtaking.  I actually sat in an alcove for 20 mins as I read about the history of the library.  Then I quietly headed to the old smoking room which is something out of a movie!  I sat in the room quietly as I looked around.<br><br>Honestly, the palace side of the 4th floor is enchanting.  I would have taken photos but I didn‚Äôt want to be a jerk since there were so many people studying.  I‚Äôm not even sure if photos are allowed.  <br><br>I poked around the first three floors but nothing else piqued my interest.  (With the entrance fee, I was limited to the first four floors.)<br><br>So grateful I got to see this beautiful library.
2;OK;Very pretty but all a bit odd really. It‚Äôs a library in a library but in the historical part there was lots of people studying which made it harder to appreciate
2;Wenckheim Palace Library ( Szabo Ervin Library );This not well advertised or locally known attractionI is well off the beaten track as far as tourists go. Never was it more evident, on asking for directions, that many of the Hungarian‚Äôs do not speak English. Reading signs on streets and maps leaves one quite exasperated. Persevere, this Budapest Metropolitan Library is a real wow. <br>A small fee 1000 HUF ($5.00 Aus) is charged to enable one to walk through the entrance, the First 3 floors equipped with thousands of books and readers. Floor 4 opens to this magnificent ( 1842-1912 ) Neo- Baroque building, three rooms all masterpieces, the Saloon and the Silver Boudoir, Small and Large Ballrooms, the Former dining room and Smoking room, now all reading rooms, so rich in ornamentation, in the style of Louis XV are the greatest unexpected wow of Budapest.
2;One of the nicest libraries I‚Äôve seen;The interior of the fanciest part of the library remind me off the library from Beauty and the Beast. Purely beautiful. Worth spending 200huf on entry. Would definitely go there to read books if only I could read in hungerian haha
2;Simply put this is a 'must see' in Budapest;i was almost inclined to put a one-star to stop this place being flooded with visitors. There was only one other couple when we went and a few students studying (with their Apple Macs) in the grandiose rooms.<br><br>Clearly, the visit is not about the books nor the 'modern' part of the library but the staggeringly beautiful old library/palace. The rooms are simply amazing. Even palaces like Versailles and Blenheim would struggle to compare. OK i accept that this is a lot smaller but - wow - some amazing rooms. I struggle to comprehend just how they have survived thru all the turbulent years.<br><br>Yes it is a bit confusing on how to get in - and yes it cost 1,000HUF per adult (just under ¬£3). But a bargain. Opens at 13h.<br><br>When 'signing-in' it was slightly amusing in that gave my name and there was a lot of punching stuff into a computer. We were then presented with three lovely tickets and a couple of photocopies in English. The lady then got up out of her seat and proceeded to guide us to the barriers and unleash a bit of chord and we were in. Almost could have done away with the tickets and all the typing. Once thru there was no indication on how to get to where the old library/palace was. A bit of hand-signal work indicated the 4th floor (by lift). Even when we came out of the lift it was not immediately evident - but we got there.<br><br>Seriously, I highly recommend.
3;Superb hotel in every way!;Wonderful hotel in heart of Budapest and right on the Clark bridge over the Danube.<br>From arrival to departure everything was superb! We had a room near the excellent spa where my husband swam every morning. The Kollazs brasserie was on point at every visit, be it Breakfast, dinner or cocktails around its great bar. Concierge arranged all our dinners and we enjoyed the great location to get around the city with ease.<br>In summary, if you are able to choose the Gresham palace as your stay in Budapest ‚Ä¶.do it‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs the best in town!
3;Fabulous hotel;Definitely worth it's 5* rating! A beautiful hotel in a great location, very easy to get to most of the key sights. Very attentive and friendly staff.
3;Quality hotel;Great location wonderful rooms wonderful art deco interiors.<br><br>This is a Four Seasons that feels like a Four Seasons. Still a large hotel but friendly and helpful.<br><br>Good location and will be even better once the bridge opp the front door is reconstructed and open again - rather a long way across to the Pest side.
3;Disappointing afternoon tea;Would not recommend afternoon tea. A lot of slights towards our table, unsure if this was on purpose, but I will give them the benefit of the doubt. Both teas came as loose leaf in the teapot, no strainer. Looked around and no one else seemed to have this issue. Also, the service was short and uninterested in coming to see to our needs. If we are less than the clientele they would like, that is fine, don't take us next time then.
3;All seasons?;The four seasons who have taken over this grand palatial place should be more welcoming of tourists all season. Especially, winter season.
3;The Palace;One is in awe when one visits Budapest. The architecture of  this Imperial city is so magnificent that I can't put enough word to describe it. A city built by the Habsburg dynasty and proclaimed it as their Imperial capital. The Austro-Hungarian Empire. And the Gresham Palace is one of those buidlings, and worth a visit.
3;Good setting with good views on Chain bridge;We enjoyed our lunch at the Lobby lounge of Four seasons Budapest. Good service and nice ambiance. Attentive staff. Special thanks to Lila<br>
3;Hotel;We popped in to have a look around. It's now a hotel. The building is grand and looks great. When we visited they still had all the christmas decorations on display which was great,
3;beautiful architecture;located near the st stephen square. it was formally an office but it now transformed into a 5star hotel. it has a beautiful architecture and intricate design.
3;Have coffee there;This former insurance office is now a 5 star hotel. To take in the grandeur we had a coffee in the elaborate foyer - great fun
3;Great stay at the Gresham Palace;Have just returned from a wonderful weekend in Budapest. Hotel was fabulous, rooms were gorgeous, staff went out of their way at every opportunity. Ate in the restaurant and had afternoon tea. Absolutely recommend. Oh, and the Christmas decorations were beautiful. Loved them.
3;A beautiful landmark.;The Gresham palace has always been and will forever be a classic and iconic landmark in Budapest, with a stunning location facing the famous Chain bridge.<br>The Christmas decorations inside the hotel's lobby were just lovely.
4;Beautiful Views;Very beautiful castle with amazing views over looking the Danube and Pest. The inner courtyard is great and plenty of information signs with details on the castle.
4;Szent Istv√°n Hall is beautiful!;Visited the Szent Istv√°n Hall and Budapest History Museum in Buda Castle (Budav√°ri Palace) in early March 2023. Great place for a visitor to learn facts about the history of Budapest. Szent Istv√°n Hall is beautiful. Amazing craftsmanship. Some parts of the Buda Castle complex were under construction during my visit. A tablet digital tour (with audio guide) for Szent Istv√°n Hall is included in the ticket price.  A must-do activity.
4;March last year we went up in cable car. There was a wine tasting festival on the top of the castle and we paid nearly equivalen;My partner and I spent hours walking around buda castle the views from the top across the Danube River are unbelievable as far as the eye can see<br>The architecture is some of the  most beautiful I have seen  on my travels <br>I have been to quiet a few country's over the years <br>As has my partner and we love  the  buda castle <br>Very spacious to walk about at the top and great for taking pictures to add to your collection <br>There is a great service with buda castle like bus thingys at the bottom on the road if someone struggles to walk up the pretty steep  walk ways <br>You can also get the fenicelor cable car up to the top
4;One more Castle;A huge place in Budapeste with a wonderful view.<br>Near the castle you can also visit the Hospital in the Rock, a place that help people in the 2nd World War.
4;Confusing entry time;We bought tickets for the museum and castle at the ticket office, given an entry time at 1400, so waited an hour in the cafe, then entered the museum at 1400. Once walked round the museum went to enter the castle and was rudely told entry at 1400. No flexibility. At no point we're we told about this. We just gave up. Waste of time and money. I have found in this city that it is a tally a waste of time visiting the official sites especially with teenage kids there is zero flexibility. Just look at the site from the outside and eat nice food don't waste your life with this.
4;Breathes history;The Budapest Castle was the highlight of our trip in Budapest. The castle towers over the entire city, and from its extensive gardens and courtyards, you can experience wonderful views of the city skyline. You can get to the castle on foot, by public transport or by the historic cable car, which is an attraction for tourists. There are several museums within the entire area of the castle, we chose one of them, which offers a cross-section of the history of the castle itself but also of the entire city. The museum itself was nothing special, but there are many exhibits and the price is very reasonable. If you decide not to visit some of the museums, be sure to at least visit the courtyards and gardens, which offer unforgettable scenery.
4;Lovely view;Beautiful castle and a must visit for Budapest! We went into the museum but I wouldn‚Äôt say this is necessary, didn‚Äôt have much of interest for us personally. But still definitely visit the castle and the grounds as beautiful!!
4;Extremely Interesting Tourist Attraction;We thoroughly enjoyed our visit here. We took our time and walked around all the grounds - there‚Äôs so much more than just the front of the palace, and all the information boards were very useful. The architecture and improvements were interesting. We visited on a Sunday morning and it wasn‚Äôt too crowded. We‚Äôd walked through on the Saturday afternoon the day before and it was very busy so we were glad to return and take our time the following morning. The Gallery was peaceful and well laid out. The visiting  exhibition was also very good. The icing on the cake was the choir singing when we arrived and the acoustics were amazing.
4;Buda site;It was a very good experience at the buda site we recommend to visit.<br>And try to go with bicycle üö≤ . And have a tour in Buda city
4;Kind of overwhelming;I wasn‚Äôt impressed honestly. A little underwhelming, a lot of people, wasn‚Äôt even a very ornate building. There was some construction work/maintenance going on that might have spoiled the experience.
4;Beautiful view;It is classified as a World Heritage Site. <br>We spent a lot of time here, including in the museum. <br>Castle offers amazing views. <br>There are a number of restaurants and bars. <br>This must-see site in Budapest is situated in the Buda neighborhood. Tourists are more inclined to visit The Pest.
4;Pleasant castle visit;Wandered around castle grounds after leaving our hotel. Signage to museum entry was very poor (especially as it was wet). Eventually followed others into building through a large door. <br>Had not booked online and thus not sure of gaining entrance, however on asking and providing proof of age we were admitted free as over 70.<br>Several staterooms to see and auxiliary exhibitions. Lots of information to read about the old monarchy and also about the architects.<br>Quite a lot of construction going on in the grounds and did not visit the art galleries as of little interest.<br>Some beautiful views across the city and especially the parliament building. Looks magnificent in sunshine and when illuminated at night.
5;Loved it so much;I loved it, booked on the 3pm tour at the desk by just walking in 15 mins beforehand - ticket offices are teeny tiny windows in the far corners either side of main entrance. Toilets are only accessible on the tour, and there‚Äôs a little performance on the stairwell at the end for all groups so find a spot and don‚Äôt move or you‚Äôll lose it as they fill up fast. Your tour guide will have a paddle with the flag of your chosen tour language on it, but sometimes there are private tours also with a language paddle, so check with guide. They don‚Äôt all set off at the same time, to allow for being able to hear your guide. Lots of opportunity for pictures, friendly and knowledgeable guide
5;Lovely;5out of 5 the architecture is marvellous although it is not that big but it is a must see when you visit budapest <br>Seen a play there
5;Opera;This was extremely stress relieving for whatever reason I always loved the Opera but I currently believe this might be the best place to hear Opera
5;Nice opera;Amazing! We did a one hour tour with a 10 minutes concert and we had a great time, the opera is in really nice condition. Beautiful outside and inside
5;A gorgeous building - wow!;We came here for our first ever visit to the Opera, Carmen. The building is gorgeous, having been subject to five years' refurbishment, only reopening just over a year ago.  The place sparkles, it is gorgeous.<br>There are clever devices in the arms of the seats, pull out tablets, on which one can see subtitles in a range of languages.  I found this really helpful.  I had read up on the storyline in advance, and was familiar with some of the music, but having the words was really helpful to my attempts at following the plot.<br>Sadly for us, most of the action was towards the left side of the stage, below our seats, so our limited view was very limited, not helped by those to our left leaning far forward onto the rail in front.  There are screens, but from where we were sitting they were too low and too small.  <br>The building itself was very warm - I had been concerned it might be cold, and it was in fact almost too warm!<br>As ever, there was a lengthy queue for the ladies in the interval, such that I didn't have time to drink my wine before we had to return to our seats.<br>Regardless of anything else, a visit to the Opera House is certainly to be recommended, it is truly gorgeous.
5;messiah : great piece the Handels Messiah;Loved our seats 1 and 2 so that we could watch the Musicans and the best was the director to see how he lead his performers with compassion and love to the exact moment. <br>It was a great piece of music!
5;Wonderful ballet performance in a stunning venue;We attended this magnificent building on Saturday 7 January to see the National Hungarian Ballet performance of The Nutcracker. The whole experience was amazing.<br>We were blown away by the ballet: the performance, the dancing, stage set, costumes, huge talented cast,  the junior and younger ballet associates, the orchestra‚Ä¶we have seen many other national ballet performances around the world (including The Nutcracker) and this performance clearly topped them all. It was fabulous.<br>The Opera House is stunning. This added another level to what we experienced. As English speakers, we found signage of where to go difficult to follow, but the staff were friendly and helpful. The arrangement of seating in the boxes gave the audience a fantastic view of the stage, and acoustics were great.<br>Highly recommend attending a performance here‚Ä¶.and especially a ballet!
5;Spectacular structure!;Incredible building with ornate Baroque features.  Built in the 1800s, it has capacity for 2,500 opera fans.
5;Beautiful opera and great tour;Beautiful opera and the english tour was super interesting. Thankfully they split the tour because the groups are really large. Definitely something not to miss when in Budapest.
5;Splendor - magical performance of the Nutcracker;Wanted to see a ballet or opera here and when I was in Hungary the Nutcracker was playing. The whole experience was fantastic. Entering the building, the cloakroom staff, seeing the stage, orchestra pit ..... Then the performance started at it was just magical. <br>If I had my time again the only thing that I would change, would be that I would get tickets in the stalls. We were in the first row of the Royal Circle. It is quite high up because there are many boxes  beneath.
6;Interesting museum, rude staff.;Interesting museum with intriguing history. I think that‚Äôs where the positives end.<br>I feel they could do so much more with the set up - it lacked content without the audio guide which you pretty much have to rely on for information. The woman on the desk mis-heard me when I asked for one and had been so rude and dismissive I felt like I would be burdening her to point out the mistake. In hindsight, considering I got so little from the content within the museum without it, it lowered the experience for me. <br>The security guard at the lift was so rude I thought he must have been joking. He waved his hand in my face when I walked towards the lift, shouted at me to ‚ÄúSTOP‚Äù and walk away. <br>The customer service at this establishment is absolutely shocking - and it clearly relies on its historical reputation to bring visitors in, and makes no effort to make the experience a wholesome one. <br>I think they had a person of importance visiting today (camera crews and big US flag on a car outside) which may have been why everyone was being so serious - but as a paying customer I was not impressed with the way the general public were being treated.
6;Worth a visit but could so easily have been made so much better.;As child to a 1956 resistance leader and emigr√© I really wanted to see this document of a dark period in Hungary‚Äôs history.  Unfortunately while I found the museum interesting and am glad I visited, my abiding impressions are not of how good it was but rather how much better it could easily have been.<br><br>A few simple changes would make a huge  difference:<br>- While the audio guide has soundtracks in several languages the signs on the exhibits are all in Hungarian.  It is as if the curators had never contemplated foreign tourists.  In one room for instance what I finally worked out was the rusting and damaged front fork of a bicycle is reverently displayed in a glass case. Why is it there?  What is the significance?  The audio guide makes few references to the exhibits so one is left with no clues.<br>- The audio guide (at least the English version) is monotonous and dry.  Is giving all dates in their longhand form really necessary?  One ends up drowning in details and at least in my case totally unable to grasp the bigger picture.    Why not include some of the video testimony from survivors in the audio guide?  Would have broken it up and made it a lot more interesting.<br>- Audio tracks playing at high volume on loudspeakers in most of the rooms create a constant backdrop of interference to the audio guide.  Really irritating.<br>- Equally irritating is the ‚Äúremote control‚Äù of the audio guide by NFC sensors at the doors of the rooms.  The idea is good, automatically start the relevant chapter as the visitor enters the room, but when the audio is restarted six times at random as one walks around the room all one wishes for is manual control.<br>- The placement of an exhibit in a (presumably deliberately) excruciatingly slow-moving lift in the middle of the museum creates a massive bottleneck, resulting in a queue and a considerable wait.  <br><br>On the positive side the physical exhibits are well chosen and presented in an aesthetic and impactful way.  The recreation of the torture chambers in the basement is grim and gut-wrenchingly powerful.  <br><br>So little needs to change to make this an unforgettable and educational experience.  Shame.
6;Average museum experience;The staff was rude for seemingly no reason. The layout of the museum was quite odd as it did not go in chronological order and was kinda jumping around to different events and years. Also, there were multiple large groups getting guided tours which meant we had to wait behind them to progress through the rooms and it was very frustrating.
6;A bit unbalanced;The museum covers both periods of totalitarianism in Hungarian history - the Nazi occupation and the communist period. The story is told using rooms with different themes, some of which correspond with periods of history and some of which are broader. While this is useful for coherence in terms of the artifacts displayed, it can sometimes make it difficult to follow the chronology.<br><br>The artifacts themselves are well-chosen and artfully displayed to create an ambiance. Throughout the museum there are video screens with short videos interviewing people who actually experienced the events and whose testimony is harrowing and poignant. Theses videos are, in fact, the most powerful part of the exhibition.<br><br>I would recommend the audio-guide as it helps you make sense of the exhibition. Having said that, it is not particularly well made. It is lengthy, and rather than aim for a good balance of facts and statistics with some well chosen stories and case studies, they have gone for an endless stream of facts, which at times can feel a bit disconnected and tedious.<br><br>While the overall exhibition is powerful and definitely worth seeing, it is very one-sided. The Hungarian collaboration with the Nazis until 1944, for example, is completely glossed over. In general the exhibition paints the Hungarians as the innocent victims of external oppression. A more nuanced account would actually be far more powerful.
6;Photos are not allowed similar to no drinks allowed in the Prohibition Era;Most of the Staff are not friendly. I am not sure if they are role playing the somber era the museum represents, or they are just not happy working there. Considering it is not a cheap museum, I did not see a single smile from the staff and it seems they are in a bad mood. What kind of policy is the no photos allowed? It is 2023. Are you trying to exclude 2 different generations of people? I know the museum is about the horrors of communism but there is no need to be stuck in that era. There are no ancient artifacts here. The only legitimate concern is that camera flash has a negative effect on older artifacts and paintings. This museum is about the horrors of communism not medieval paintings so I am not sure what the concern is. That being said there are 1000s of photos of this museum online just because people cannot help themselves and going to sneak photos either way. I was really thrown off by the whole attitude of this museum. It's a shame because it's so well built and it represents such important time line and lessons for humanity but the management needs a reality check in regards with modern tourism.<br><br>In 2023 I had this old lady following me around like a criminal to see if I am taking photos after her warning. So creepy.<br><br>5 for the museum content<br><br>1 for the policy and staff<br><br>Poor experience for me.
6;Avoid at all cost;-unbelievably rude staff, unlike anywhere in Hungary. <br>-revisionist history, showing Hungary only as a victim. Even though so many politicians willingly collaborated with the Nazis. <br>-Many parts hard to understand if one does not understand Hungarian. <br>-Place gets overcrowded very quickly.
6;Interesting museum;Very interesting museum showing a less talked about side of history. Well worth a visit to experience and understand a different form of atrocities committed in Hungary. Definitely upgrade for the audio tour as it really helps with the museum experience.  Very harrowing but definitely worth the visit.
6;Ode to Freedom Fights;Great history museum covering the times of Nazi and Soviet occupation, both difficult and turbulent times for Hungary. If you're an EU/Schengen resident, a discount for some, and free for others (kids), usually applies, but you have to present proof of it as the staff were very very uptight about verifying this. Not a very suitable place for kids under 12 given the subject matter and some photos/stories seen throughout. Audio guide really helps paint a clearer picture of what happened. The exhibitions were well thought out and the explanations tend to give clear points on what happened. <br>Bookstore at the end and small cafe. Very good museum, and the building itself is especially significant given the holding cells and torture chambers still seen in the basement.
6;A chilling story, well told but unwelcoming;A terrible story very well told with some informative exhibits, more poignant given events in Ukraine.<br><br>Spoilt only by some unhelpful staff on arrival, which was surprising for Budapest.
6;Absolutely fascinating;I found it absolutely fascinating. The history of what the Hungarians went through with the fascist Arrow Cross Party, the Nazis and the communists was incredible.  I think the cost was 7000Huft including the audio guide. You start the tour on the second floor and work your way down through the different rooms showing videos, pictures, uniforms, explanations of events etc and finish in the basement where the cells are located. Both harrowing and fascinating.
6;It was okay;Interesting, educational museum- felt more like a memorial as many rooms were very bare. If you don‚Äôt speak any Hungarian, make sure to get the audio guide as the majority of the museum is in Hungarian- the information at the front entrance was all translated so we assumed everything inside would be too so didn‚Äôt get an audio guide. There were some information sheets in each room that you could take away with you but they were very long and most of the English versions had been taken so we felt we missed key information. Very warm, dark and busy. A very long wait for what turned out to be a very slow elevator ride featuring a disturbing video on hanging. No photos allowed inside. Would recommend if you need some to fill some time while in Budapest, but wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a must see.
6;Very moving.;This place is worth a visit. We had no idea what the Hungarian people had to endure when they were occupied by first the Germans and then the Russians and the impact of communism.
7;Surprise;The National Library in Budapest is within easy reach if you take a bus from the inner city or from Sz√©ll K√°lm√°n t√©r. After having a thorough look at the astounding environment you may as well visit the temporary exhibits. I did so. One of the gems was a collection about Houdini, the escape artist. Another small exhibition was about Mr. B√≠r√≥ who invented the ball point pen. You should definitely spend an hour inside this building and if you have some research you'll doubtless find material inside. Just opposite you may walk right in the National Gallery, if not, I would recommend a stroll first on the Danube side and finish your escapade in one of the busy pastry shops a few hundred meters from the palace.
7;amazing interior, but dont touch anything;Was a bit tough to find the correct door to actually get in but once you do‚Ä¶id recommend you have cash to pay the admission .  when i was there the computer was down. my ticket was a post it note and thankfully i had enough cash .<br><br>Once you get through all that you open the door to a spectacular room.  The main reading  room is huge.  The detail and workmanship that went into this is obvious.  <br><br>If you are a fan of interesting buildings, architecture, old books and really big ladders you should stop by.<br><br>Tripadvisor said it opens at 9am‚Ä¶. I got there at 945 and it didn't open till 10am so check

8;Use the Matthias Budapest Church app;Visited Matthias Church (M√°ty√°s-templom) in early March 2023. Truly spectacular! Tickets to tour the temple and/or tower can be purchased on-site, online or through the Matthias Budapest Church app. The Matthias Budapest Church app has a self-guided temple tour. Visitor hours are limited on weekends. A visit to Budapest is not complete without visiting Matthias Church.
8;A Very Detailed Design;The church was definitely one of my favorite things to see on the Budapest trip. Tickets are purchased outside. Opening hours are from 13:00 till 17:00 but I suggest buying tickets earlier because they can be sold out. The inside of the church is very intricately designed. It‚Äôs covered with beautiful paintings and stain glass windows. The second floor consists of marvelous staircase and a small museum like room.
8;Matthias Church Tour and Castle District;Terrific tour with excellent guide Balint who gave lots of interesting detail and kept the small group entertained. Thoroughly recommend
8;Stunning church on the castle hill;Matthias church is an amazing building, from the beautiful spire to the wonderful tiled roof to the beautiful stained glass windows and amazing interior. It was built in the mid 1400's in the Gothic style. It is located in front of Fisherman's Bastion You can purchase the tickets to enter the church from across the square.<br>We did the multi ticket and did the tower as well. Well worth the time and money when you are in Budapest.
8;Really interesting;After catching the castle bus up to the area we decided to look around this beautiful church.<br>It has great stained glass windows and everywhere inside is painted<br>Well worth a visit.  As we are pensioners it was only 1,900 HUF each
8;Painted everywhere;A gorgeous church which is completely painted inside. It‚Äôs 2500 HUF to enter and as it was Sunday it was only open from 1300. <br>Make sure to climb up to the gallery as there are religious artefacts, including the royal thrones and spectacular views of the church below.
8;Lovely area;Impressive church at Fisherman's Bastion. The roof being the most 'fancy' part. Definitely worth being in the area to take a look.
8;Lovely Church;The church is recessed into the ground and you descend to the main floor by stairway. However, there is a mezzanine that overlooks the main floor and the altar area.  There are artifacts in the church to look at.
8;Shining temple or worship on the hill!;Mathias Church (officially known as the  Church of the Assumption of the Buda Castle) is a fabulous structure inside and out.  According to church lore, the first church at this site was erected in 1015, but the main elements of the current imposing Gothic structure were built in 12th and 13th centuries.  The church has undergone numerous additions and renovations over the years.  The graceful bell tower rises 78 meters tall.  One of the most attention-grabbing features of the interior are the beautiful stained-glass windows. The church's organ, known as the "King's Organ" (I'm not joking!) has 7,771 pipes.
8;Very beautiful!!;Don't miss the visit inside! This gothic style church has fully decorated walls and wonderful stained glass windows!
8;Amazing church;Matthias Church is one of the most beautiful tourist attractions from Budapest for sure. It is an amazing church located in Buda Castle area. Its architecture is stunning.
8;Absolutely beautiful!;Budapest has some of the most amazing buildings! The Matthias Church is a must in your travels while in Budapest. The architecture is incredible, walking around the building feels like you're in a Harry Potter movie. It simply magical!
9;Magical at night!;Enjoyed views of Fisherman's Bastion (Hal√°szb√°stya) during a visit to Budapest in early March 2023. Stunning historical landmark. Really beautiful at all parts of the day but it seems magical at night. Perfect spot to enjoy views the Hungarian Parliament Building, the river Danube, sunrise and sunset.
9;Very Unique Architecture;The Fishermen‚Äôs Bastion is very uniquely beautiful. The pointy towers are breathtaking. We managed to take a bus to the location which was fast and efficient. You need to pay a small fee to access a specific part of the Bastion, which could have been made free because it‚Äôs a small part. Apart from that you can visit the Saint Matthias Church by purchasing tickets outside. <br>Overall it was definitely worth seeing!
9;Nice place;Very nice and cool place to see. Perfect place for taking pictures. Tickets are not expensive, but it‚Äôs only a small part to visit which is included in the tickets. <br>Definitely recommend
9;Very crowded;Nice views of the city. You have to pay extra to go on top to get the good pics. Next to Matthias church so you can hit two places at once. It‚Äôs very busy tho so be aware
9;Great views and lots to do in the area;Great views and lots to do in the area. Some really good photo opportunities. Didn‚Äôt bother buying a ticket because there was plenty to see without one and I couldn‚Äôt really tell what the people who did have tickets could see that you couldn‚Äôt already see without tickets.
9;Worth a visit!;Great views! It wasn‚Äôt too crowded either. We took the number 16 bus up from outside the metro (go up the little outside escalator and cross the road). Worth noting that the toilets are 250hof but the Starbucks gave us a warm welcome, a delicious coffee, a sort of view and a free wee!
9;A fine structure offering excellent views of the Danube;Fisherman‚Äôs bastion, located in Buda, is easily reachable from Pest on foot, or via tram, as long as you are willing to climb some steps! The structure has been kept in great condition, and the view is superb at the top, you can see right over the Danube including the majestic Hungarian Parliament Building. <br><br>Fisherman‚Äôs bastion is free to access, so I would highly recommend taking the uphill walk if you are spending a few days in Budapest.
9;Once upon a time....;Easy to reach via funicular for a small cost or by foot up the hill. Not a long walk to the area from the funicular stop and easy to find due to the crowds of people wandering around. The area is very unusual and is like little fairytale castles. There are stunning views across the river to the parliament building and the Chain Bridge.<br>We visited 9 years ago and they now seem to have made it more of a tourist trap by charging you a fair amount of money to climb the top turrets - absolutely no need to do this as you do not get a better view than at the lower level. It's just a rip off!
9;A must go;An absolute must go on the Buda side, especially if the weather is nice. Amazing views over the city and the parliament. Easily accessible by bus.
9;Stunning views of the Danube and beyond!;Fabulous views out over the Danube and across to the Pest side.  Hugely popular with tourists, who are constantly jockeying for position for photos.  It's worth the small fee to go up on the terrace for better views and photos.
9;Iconic Overlook!;Right next to the Matthias Church, the massive neo-Gothic, neo-Romanesque structure, known as Fisherman‚Äôs Bastion, is an extension of the ancient city wall which, back in the Middle Ages, was defended by the guild of local fishermen assigned by the king. It looks like something out of a fairy tale. The bastion itself was built between 1895 and 1902 to mark the millennial anniversary of Hungarian statehood. The seven towers of the bastion symbolize seven Hungarian chieftains who led their tribes to the land of contemporary Hungary back in the 9th century AD. The turrets on top of them are quite popular spots with photography lovers for the great shots they provide over the mighty river Danube down below and the Pest side of the city on the opposite bank. The bastion‚Äôs terrace is free, but they charge to climb the turrets. <br><br>The centerpiece of the bastion is the statue of St Stephen, the first Hungarian king who ruled the country between 1000 and 1038. The wide ceremonial staircase leading to it is also lined with several statues including that of John Hunyadi ‚Äì military commander and statesman, the statue of St George Piercing the Dragon, as well as those of the 10th-century soldiers guarding the gate, sitting at the top of the stairs, under the arch. From here, you can snap some breathtaking pictures of the Danube River, Margaret Island, and Pest.
9;Stunning place;Absolutely stunning views, with wonderful buildings all around. We really enjoyed our few hours here, there was lots to see even on a rainy day in November
10;A v√°rosliget;Fantastic project with an incredible vision. Changing the park from a Soviet neglected area to one of the best parks in Europe, perfect for anyone to enjoy. Incredible architecture and really relaxing.
10;Good park,rather large with zoo.;Overall a nice park with many statues and old buildings scattered about it. There are also several toilets,some you pay for,one is free but some of the pay ones where out of action. There also a massive sloping garden with a metal memorial between to two sides of it. When we visited there was no water in either the lake or the moat and it looked like it was going to stay that way for a little while. There is also a brand new cultural centre/music hall just been built in a modern style. The park also contains the city zoo.
10;Great walks;Such a large green park in the city.<br>The park offers great walk paths and many things to see.<br>I visited this park to see the statues there and especially the statue of the Albanian National Hero Gjergj Kastrioti - Skenderbej.<br><br>At the time we visited the park on December there was a skiing place.
10;Lovely park - lots to see and do. Easy to stroll around;Lovely open park space. Great for walking or cycling. Free acces. Visited in December when there was an ice rink (entry fee) set up. Amazing buildings around the park housing a variety of cultural activities. Lots of places to get food and drink.<br>Also access to Szechenyi thermal baths (fee to enter)
10;Largest Park in Budapest;We have been to Budapest twice, and always enjoy spending time in this very large park because there are so many interesting buildings, gardens, and statues. as well as several cafes where you can relax and enjoy the views.
10;The largest green park in Budapest;I like this beautiful park very much. It‚Äôs 100 hectare, near Heroes‚Äô Square and Zoo. There are lots of entertainment and relaxing facilities, museums, Vajdahunyad Castle. If you are tired of traffic and noise, you can hide and relax here. We walked there and saw the House of Music and Etnography Museum.
10;I love city parks;I love city parks no matter which country they are in. I love how people enjoy the parks.  This one is a pleasure to stroll through. Enjoy
10;Impressive Ôªøhuge green space;We entered this huge green space at Ajt√≥si D√ºrer sor, end, finishing at Heroes Square, the park its self is lovely just to walk around, enjoying the peaceful, tranquility, if that is not enough there are also places to visit and see.<br> Millennium House and fountain. beautiful structure, cafe and museum.<br>various monuments and statues<br>Vajdahunyad castle
10;Nice stroll;It is a nice big area with a lot of  green areas and plenty of activities such as Heroes Square, Szechenyi Bath and the zoo, etc.<br>An absolute must to see! :-)
10;Large park with zoo, thermal baths and castle;Varosliget (city park) is a large (~1.5km x 1km) public park surrounding Hero's Square.  It features the city zoo, botanical gardens, Sz√©chenyi thermal baths, a fountain, Vajdahunyad castle, Former Pet≈ëfi Hall, Hero's Square, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Palace of Art and several restaurants/cafes.  Paddle boats can be rented on a lake, and there is ice skating in the winter. Strolling, jogging or biking around the park is quite pleasant, with paved walks, benches, a couple lakes, formal gardens, a fountain and historic castles peeking above the trees.  The park is accessible at all times with no entry fee.
10;Stunning area and ice rink;We walked up the beautifully lit road to Heroes Square, a stunning array of architecture and lovely at night. The ice rink looked wonderful and was bigger than a football pitch. A lovely place to spend time in the day or at night,
10;Excellent;Impressed with the architecture and it is unexpectedly amazing, strolling from Hero Square, lead to thermal Bath and pass through nice park and it is right there. Definitely worth a visit
11;Poor;Most overrated place compared to other things to do in Budapest, overpriced for what it is and not the cleanest of places (mostly dated I would say) . Spent 2 hours to try get our moneys worth but left and went to the zoo over the road which actually was a decent day out.<br><br>Would only recommend for a photo for the gram to say you have been.
11;Well worth a visit;Beautiful surroundings and lovely thermal waters. We had read the reviews beforehand and so glad we booked a cabin. There's a great choice of indoor and outdoor pools   get there early as it gets really busy.
11;Go you won‚Äôt be disappointed;Booked online on the day of visit. Easy transaction and didn‚Äôt have to wait in the long queues at the entrance, just had to show the online ticket. We booked the day ticket with a cabin. It was a good choice as you get allocated a cabin where you can change and store your belongings. It cost just under ¬£25:00 per person weekday ticket. The baths are huge with lots of different pools and saunas. They have a cafe on site and you can buy drinks. The outdoor thermal pool was great best I have visited so far. We took our own towels and flip flops to save on costs. Easy accessible by public transport. Go you won‚Äôt be disappointed.
11;Good but information beforehand could be clearer;Booked in advance so disappointed to find swimming pool closed for refurbishment.  However, thermal pools lovely and lots of sun loungers around the baths.  Needed to take a towel which we didn‚Äôt realise but perhaps we misread the information??  Also valuables locked away downstairs in cloakroom, yet needed to buy drinks so again perhaps information could be clearer.
11;Good day out;It was very easy to find the baths as it has it's own stop from the Deak Ferenc Ter (bus 72).<br>We had a lovely day, opted for a cabin where we had individual lockable cubicles.<br>The weather was clear, it was a bit chilly so we chose to warm up in the indoor baths first, all the pools had their temperature on plaques. There was at least 2 of each temperature pool so space wasn't an issue for these.<br>We did enjoy the aromatherapy sauna (dry sauna), but weren't able to get into the other saunas as they were always full.<br>We did go into the outdoor pool and was pleasantly surprised at how warm it felt.<br>The only downside is, for the price you pay for entry, the buildings and changing areas are very dated and a bit lackluster, I'd still recommend it as a fun experience though.
11;Abrupt staff, no info on pools;I was looking forward to going here, however was very  disappointed.  The staff were awful, very abrupt, no assistance/direction given and there was no  information signs on the pools. There are a few pools inside but we had no idea what these were for.  Downstairs saunas were closed too.
11;An amazing experience in the snow;Amazing in the winter! To be in the heated pool, while the snow falls around you is a wonderful experience.<br><br>Be prepared for communal changing rooms.
11;Great architecture. Better than expected.;Had read a few mixed reviews about these baths, so came with some trepidation. Followed the general advice to go in the morning, but being a Saturday it was still quite busy. Really enjoyed our visit. Water was warm but not so warm that you end up feeling uncomfortable. Visited the steam room as well which was good. Signing in the complex isn't great and can be a bit confusing. We paid for a cabin as well, which I would recommend. Came away thinking good but a bit pricey.
11;An absolute must do.;Best part of the holiday. I would recommend booking before as the queue can get quite large to buy tickets. If you can get there mid week it seems to be less busy too. Another thing worthwhile was booking cabin tickets. You get use of it all day as a private space and also can leave your things in there- it is locked electronically so perfectly safe.<br>Make sure to take your own towel and flip flops/ slides are compulsory so take some of those as well.<br><br>The atmosphere and aesthetics are great, the water is a perfect temperature and there is a relaxed vibe. No children playing sports games around/ in the pool etc. The indoor pools are much smaller but equally as warm and relaxed - a little more noisy though.<br><br>Would do this again in a heartbeat. Great experience all round
11;Expensive for an afternoon but is definitely a must do experience when visiting.;A DEFINITE MUST DO WHEN IN BUDAPEST. ONE OF THE BEST ATTRACTIONS WE VISITED.<br>Lets get the cost out of the way first, yes, it was expensive per person at about $35 Aud each ($70 Aud for two people). Lets also justify that cost, you spend approx. $2000 Aud each to fly to Europe and you have normally saved up for sight seeing expenses so $70 for spending 3 to 4 hours in one of Budapest's best attractions is fairly good.<br>This is the one of the oldest thermal bath's in Budapest built in 1913 and it is very ornate and is a wonderful building.<br>You can either bring your own thongs / towels / bathers or can buy them from the spa (cost builds up when doing this).<br>You get a wrist band which is similar sized to an apple watch which allows you ta access a locker. You just find a free locker and use that. It is safe but always take the normal precautions. Ensure it's locked before you leave it.<br>There is two large thermal spa's outside in the main area with a swimming pool in-between.  We spent most of our time in here. There area some smaller internal pools which are OK but most of the action and charm is in the outside two thermal pools. I loved the whirlpool action and enjoyed doing a few spins in the whirlpool area. Everyone was having fun doing that.<br>This is definitely a must do even though its a tad expensive. But hey, you spend thousands flying to Europe so ensure you spend the money and you'll enjoy every cent spent you spend by the experience and fun you will have.<br>It was one of my top moments when travelling 34 days in Europe.
12;Located in V√°rosliget Park;Located in Liget Budapest (V√°rosliget Park). Visited Vajdahunyad Castle on a cold, cloudy Monday in early March 2023. No lake or water features during the winter season. I got a ticket for the Gate Tower and enjoyed nice views from the top.
12;Avoid the rip off mulled wine stand;Its a fun area to walk around. we didnt go into the castle. It will also be nice in the spring and summer as there is a big park around it. Just one tip: avoid the sellers of mulled wine just in front of the castle. The wine cost 3000 Huf per glass and it is watered down so much its more like lemonade.
12;A Must in Budapest;What an amazing place. We really enjoyed the view of the buildings. A lot of great architectural elements can be seen at this location. Photos say all.
12;Really nice!;Vajdahunyad Castle (Vajdahunyadvar) is a must to see. You can also walk up to the top of the gate (individually) and the tower (only by guided tours). <br>This is an impressive building before or after visiting the Heroes' Square.
12;Kind of a let down;The structure is a beautiful sight to see. We did not know anything about the castle prior to arrival, but I thought online comments about it raved about its history, scary factor, etc.  We bought the whole package to see/do everything including a guided tour, but honestly it was disappointing when our tour guide did not greet us, just motioned for us to follow her up many flights of stairs with zero conversation.  It wasn't until about 5 minutes after we reached the top of the tower she began to tell us a little about one side, then another, and so on. She talked maybe 5 minutes. We learned no one had ever lived there, it has always been a museum (of hunting, fishing and early man living conditions). It just was not what I had expected. The church was closed and many parts of the museum were empty.
12;Very nice;Very pleasant and fairytale atmosphere. Of course many people, but not overcrowded what makes it a beautiful royal place to take a walk with your girlfriend or wife
12;Beautiful castle inside the City Park;Vajdahunyad Castle is inside the City Park.  The whole area is nice and calm and peaceful.  The building is gorgeous.  It s a perfect place for wedding photos - as we saw a newly wed couples taking photos.
12;Peaceful Vajdahunyad Castle;This place is absolutely calm and peaceful opposite to the famous e Szechenyi thermal baths. You could just sit here for hours around the castle that has a park watching the ducks and relax .
12;Beautiful recreations in a lovely park setting for everyone to enjoy;To be clear, Vajdahunway Castle and surrounding structures are not ‚Äúold‚Äù by Hungarian standards.  Build in 1896, they‚Äôre only 125 year old.  But they‚Äôre beautiful and, situated in calming park-like settings, the are defintely a must see in Budapest.  Clearly, locals love this area as they hang out all day and night in this area enjoy the views and buildings.  The the structures themselves, while not 700+ years old, the wonderful to look at and playful to the eyes.  Interior visits are not necessary‚Ä¶everything to see can be seen from the exterior.  But it‚Äôs still a fund way to spend the afternoon.
12;The most beautiful Middle Ages is the Middle Ages built in the XIX-XX centuries.;As the famous restovrator Violette Le Duc proved in the XIX century, the most beautiful Middle Ages is the Middle Ages built in the XIX century. Medieval architects were interested in cheapness and functionality, they were not up to turrets and bay windows. Would they have been able to build a Neuschwanstein or a Pierrefond in its current form? In the case of Vajdahunyad, it is even more interesting. No one was going to build a castle. It's just that together with Heroes Square, on the 1000th anniversary of the so-called finding of the Motherland in 1896, they decided to build a mock-up of the castle in the city park (Varoshliget). The architect Ign√°c Alp√°r incorporated elements of 21 famous buildings in Hungary, including Hunyad Castle (Corvin Castle) in Transylvania. The whole of Hungary turned out to be in one layout, with different pavilions built in different architectural styles: Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque. And all this is made of plywood, wood and even papier-mache. But nothing is more permanent than temporary. Pavilions as temporary structures began to deteriorate naturally and pose a danger to life. They decided to demolish them. However, Alp√°r made such a beautiful layout that the people of Budapest wanted to see it in stone. Said and done. The castle was built in 4 years. After all, there were already cranes and construction machines! Fearing Hungarian separatism, the castle was opened in 1908 by the elderly Franz Joseph. The beauty of the castle is that it is always open (in the sense of a courtyard and a bridge). Not Neuschwanstein. There is an agricultural museum in the castle itself, but I suspect most tourists are not interested in it at all. The famous Hungarian wine-making and pig-making is better to explore in the nearest restaurant.
12;Ok Attraction;We stopped here before visiting the baths one day. It‚Äôs a cool place to check out, but it‚Äôs not really a castle, it‚Äôs actually not really even a building. Sure, swing by and check it out, but it is crazy this is the top attraction in Budapest right now.
12;Late 19th Century Castle;The castle has a beautiful exterior, but it is not as old as it seems. It was constructed in 1896 as a copy of Hunyad Castle, known as Corvin Castle, which is located in Hedoara, Romania.<br><br>Like much of the park it stands in, it was built as part of the Millennial Exhibition which celebrated the 1,000 years of Hungary since the Hungarian Conquest of the Carpathian Basin in 895. <br><br>The castle features copies of several landmark buildings from different parts of the Kingdom of Hungary, including the Jaki Chapel which is a replica of J√°ki church, an Abbey in Vas County.<br><br>The Castle was originally made from cardboard and wood, but it became so popular that it was rebuilt with stone and brick between 1904 and 1908.
13;Second largest concert hall;Vigad√≥ is Budapest's second largest concert hall.<br><br>This building was designed in 1859.<br><br>It replaced another concert hall damaged and then was damaged itself in the 1848 War of Independence.
13;An unlisted gem!;We were walking along the Danube when we saw this beautiful building.  We crossed over to investigate and found that it was a concert hall and museum.  We enjoyed the interior of the building as much as some of the art displays.  The glass and ceramic displays were beautiful.  Since we are both senior citizens we didn't have to pay to enter (which we would certainly have done just to see the building).  Good find!
13;My favorite one in Budapest;The pompous stairs with Mable columns, frescos on the ceiling and on the walls are taking  us back in time to the atmosphere of the balls and one can hear the music of Liszt, Wagner, Brams, Strauss who were playing in this concert hall.<br>The last restoration of this concert hall is very successfully processed.<br>There are different kinds of exhibitions are been hold in Vigad√≥ as well as concerts and music concours.<br>There is a balcony with amazing panoramic view on the7th floor of this building and a small expo about the history of Pesti Vigado. <br>
13;Elegant concert hall on the Pest side of the Danube;Pesti Vigad√≥ ("Place for Merriment") is about 400m south of the Pest end of the Sz√©chenyi Chain Bridge.  Budapest's second largest concert hall is the home stage of the Hungarian State Folk Ensemble.  The building (1859, architect Frigyes Feszl) is a mixture of Oriental and Hungarian Art Nouveau with romantic elements and pleasing adornments.  It was badly damaged during World War II, restored, listed as a National Monument in 1954, and reopened to the public in 1980.   Inside, a soaring lobby connects to a grand staircase leading to a large and ornate concert hall.  There is a lecture and an exhibition hall on the fifth floor and a sixth-floor terrace with panoramic views over Buda and the River Danube.  Pesti Vigado is open every day from 10am to 7:30pm, and is beautifully lit at night.    Current performances are listed on their website.
13;A must to see;Pesti Vigado is a beautiful building. The ballroom is fantastic, check out out the tiny details! It is awesome! <br>A MUST TO SEE! :-)
13;Beautiful building;Very beautiful historic building of more than 150 years. Here was the banquet for the coronation of Emperor Franz Joseph, and now is a concert hall. The evening it is very well lit.
13;Pretty area;A pretty area with a nice fountain (photos attached) with nice views of the Danube and capital hill. It is very close to shopping and restaurants. Unfortunately there was no water running since it is winter time and there was a dead rat laying in the fountain that my daughter saw and asked why it was sleeping LOL. Anyway, with that exception it‚Äôs a nice area.
13;Beautifully Restored;I took a guided tour and visited the free exhibit about memories of events held in this building.  The guide explained how and why this is such an important building to Hungarians.  The restoration was completed just a view years ago so the building systems are state of the art.  The decor takes you back to the mid 1800‚Äôs.  Twice the building was seriously damaged by enemies.  Some elements such as at least part of the main stair are original.  It is not obviously, except for in the concert hall itself, what is new and what dates from earlier times.<br><br>A very interesting item is a new, modern piano designed using materials used to build aircraft.  I would have liked to have heard it played.
13;Pesti Vigado;Pesti Vigado is situated at Vigado ter 2 by a small park at the river Danube. Beautiful architecture.
13;Beautiful Inside and Out - Well Worth It!;Walk through a small park and you are right at the river. That is how close this building is to the riverfront. Top floor has history of this building and a rooftop view of the river valley. Go before afternoon sun makes it hard to take pictures. Fifth floor had art displays. Much yet to see on second floor and main floor. I got in for half price (1250 Ft) for being 68 and my wife was free for being a couple years older.
13;Wonderful Architecture and exhibit halls;The Pesti Vigado captured my eye the first time I visited Budapest, but I never went inside.  This trip I decided to explore the interior which was magnificent.  One of the halls featured an exhibit of graphic artist L√≠viusz Gyulia and another hall showcased work by J√≥zef Palot√°s.  It was the perfect winter escape though depending on what exhibits are going on...I would visit Pesti Vigado again.
13;Beautiful Hall with Great Art;We were attracted by the appearance of the building and had no idea how beautiful it is inside until we entered.  It is like a palace, although it has never served as a residence.  In the lobby is the beautiful <br>Bog√°nyi piano (Google it!), and the current art exhibit of beautiful hand painted paper works are exquisite.  Liszt himself performed more than once in the concert hall.  Be sure to take the elevator to the top floor for a very nice view of the river and Buda.
14;A bridge!!!;Magnificent structure built across the Danube River.  Clearly a challenge to those the built it.  Both, vehicle and peatonal cross.
14;Connection from Buda to Pest;With the chain bridge still closed to pedestrians this is the best was to get from buda to pest for the major attractions on the buda side. it not as fancy as the chain but its a short walk with nice scenery and you can catch a number of buses to cross
14;Nice stroll;With the Chain Bridge being closed when we visited we had to walk across Elisabeth Bridge to get to Buda Hill funicular and up to Fisherman's Bastion. You also come out just off the bridge when you walk down Vaci Street. <br>It was a busy bridge traffic wise (presumably more so being as the Chain Bridge is closed) but was fine to walk across it. The yellow trams also go across it so we got some quirky pictures in between the traffic!
14;Getting to the other side!;The Elizabeth Bridge features clean classic lines.  One of the main bridges crossing the Danube in Budapest.  Built in 1964.
14;The Elisabeth Bridge;One of the 3 bridges that links Buda to Pest.  Used extensively to move vehicles over the Danube River.  It was built in 1897 but was destroyed in WW2 and rebuilt in 1961.<br>  Today, the large bronze statue of Elisabeth of Bavaria sits by the bridge's Buda side connection in the middle of a small garden.
14;Easy enough to walk across;Nice enough bridge that is very easy to walk overover the Danube and one of the three main bridges in the Budapest centre. It is nice to do a Danube Sightseeing Cruise which gives good views of all the bridges
14;Lovely, as always.;This white bridge, connecting Buda with Pest, remains beautiful whether you decide to cross it, or if you choose to gaze at it from afar.
14;Across the Danube river;This is one of several impressive bridges crossing the Danube river, you can get a good view from the hill behind it, it's very much worth climbing up for a peek!
14;Bridge of "Sissi" ... the name still held even through the communist era.;For sure one of the attractions of this beautiful city are its bridges. This is one of the bridges crossing the Danube and also the most unusual of the bridges. <br>It was named after Queen Elizabeth of the Austrian-Hungarian empire - known to many only as Sissi. Interesting thing that during the communist era in Hungary the name was not changed (the "Franz Josef" bridges name was changed into "Freedom").<br>It was blown up during WWII in 1945 by the retreating german army and it was so severely damaged that it was beyond repair so in 1960 this bridge was built to replace the old one. <br>There are several spots to see the bridge with a very nice view, one of those is from the "Citadela" hill and another one is from the deck of river cruise ship. <br>So, when you are in Budapest, check out the bridges also ...
14;Elegant;The Elisabeth Bridge is rebuilt of original eclectic flamboyant style bridge, which was completely destroyed by the withdrawing German troops at the end of WWII.<br>It is a very elegant white bridge.
14;Beautiful at night;This steel bridge spanning (290meters) the Danube river is named after Elisabeth of Bavaria, Queen of the Austro Hungarian Empire 1837-1898, From our point of view it is a fairly plain bridge, (serving its purpose), however, it comes alive at night. Awesome piccies to be had.
14;Suspension bridge across the narrowest part of the Danube;Elisabeth Bridge connects Buda and Pest spanning the narrowest part of the Danube (290m).  It is named after Elisabeth of Bavaria, a popular queen and empress of Austria-Hungary (the spouse of Francis Joseph I), who was assassinated in Geneva in 1898.  The original 1903 suspension bridge was destroyed during the WW II, and replaced by the functional but austere current bridge in 1964, designed by P√°l S√°voly, and built on the piers of the original bridge.  The eastern end of the bridge is in March 15 Square, and the western end is in D√∂brentei Square (which contains a statue of Queen Elisabeth).  The Buda end is near the Saint Gell√©rt monument, and the R√°cz  and Rudas Baths.  The bridge is beautifully lit at night, and is accessible at all times with no entry fee.   It may easily be crossed on a wide pedestrian pathway on both sides.
15;What a wonderful surprise;We got tickets for Saturday group guided tour in English followed by a concert of one of the Academy students. The tour was very informative. I didn‚Äôt expect at all to see such a grand concert hall inside. It‚Äôs #5 in the world with the best acoustic! All decorations are simply exquisite. I wish we would stay longer in Budapest as I would love to see classical concert in this wonderful hall
15;Music art in right venue;A short concert during a  tour of Budapest. Excellent music artists, beautiful Art Nouveau concert hall. Nice experince
15;Very Interesting History and Beautiful Building;They only give tours at certain times of the day, but this was a very beautiful and interesting building to visit and learn about Franz Liszt. It is located on a nice street with shops and cafe's nearby. If we had more time, we definitely would have loved to tour the academy.
15;If you're lucky enough to score tickets to a concert;An art nouveau architectural gem and a fabulous concert hall for classical music. By all means, try to get tickets to a concert and transport yourself back into the belle epoch. Magnficent!
15;art nouveau;Liszt Academy is an amazing Art nouveau bulding, with elements that surprise the visitor in every step.
15;Hungarian music and musicians at their best;Classical music performed to the perfection demanded by the local audience of connaisseurs. Liszt, Bartok, and Kodaly are frequently on the programme. Your ears will be charmed by the melodies while your eyes will enjoy the decor. A most enjoyable evening to be complimented by drinking a glass of Hungarian champagne while admiring the Art Nouveau mosaics in the foyer during the intervals.
15;Stunning Building;Came across by accident whilst exploring Budapest, its a truly stunning building. I would suggest if you are into music you should visit.
15;Bartok Piano Finalists;Whatever the musical offering, be sure to attend it at this beautiful hall. We were fortunate to hear the three finalists of the 2019  Bartok Piano Competition and it was outstanding. Great hall for acoustics and intimacy of stage to seating.
15;Exceptional Concert Experience;So much to enjoy in one open space. An art nouveau building with history and, as it turns out, great acoustics. We didn't have a tour but we walked around the public areas before and after attending a concert from a visiting orchestra. The organ was first played at the building's opening in the late 19th century by Franz Liszt himself.  <br><br>The acoustics were clear with just the right amount of reverb.  Modern lighting makes the stage and performers look great. With a visiting orchestra from Belgium, our concert was very reasonably priced.<br><br>A note about classical music in many European cities including Budapest, Prague, Vienna, and Venice, etc. There are plenty of nightly tourist performances with pieces you have heard - Pachelbel Canon, Dvorak New World Symphony, Vivaldi Four Seasons, etc.  These performances are ok but generally overpriced.  The performances that made these cities famous are found at the primary halls in the city. It pays to do your research and it pays to attend these performances to really experience what a classical concert is like. <br><br>Before going search to see what's going on. There will be a long list of nightly performances - these are the tourist performances by freelance musicians for the most part. Like something? Go for it. No need to by in advance. But search on the cultural institutions of each city and then go directly to their sites to see if any performances are taking place while you're in town.  The extra expense, if any, is well worth it.
15;lovely building and arcitecture;a lovely building, which is worth seeing.  possible better tahn opera and less cost and less tourists.  ifyou can go to a concert there, that is nice also.  just hope it is a good one.  we went to one of gustav mahler's music, which was a mistake, but it did not take away from the beauty of the concert hall.  a nice evening in budapest
15;amazing;It was an interesting tour in a beautiful building and we had a short piano concert given by an extremely talented young student. Highly recommend.
15;Must Visit;Beautiful concert hall with  reasonable prices. Look online for performances as the bigger names get sold out quickly. Walking distance from most of Pest.
16;Experience of a lifetime;Entrance includes individual locker and use of change cabinet.  The thermal baths themselves were better than we had expected.
16;Worse thermal baths in Europe;We visited the thermal baths in April. We were really exited since we read they were the best in Europe. Altogether we were extremely disappointed. The sauna and steam baths were out of service and no one informed us at the reception. And when we asked the reception why we were not informed they were very rude and impolite!! Overall it was overpriced and it‚Äôs not worth the visit
16;Couples visit;Went mid week and the place was very quiet which was really nice. Lovely experience. Only negatives were one of the pools was closed and it said the outdoor pools were closed but when we left we realised they were actually open! Take a towel and get a changing cabin.
16;Worth a try;It was a nice experience to try the hot baths in a plus 100 years old building. You have some options of hot baths, saunas, hot rooms and massage. You also have a nice swimming pool but keep in mind you need a swimming hat to enter.
16;Excellent spa experience. Visit early morning to beat the rush.;We went in the morning so it wasn't so crowded and also we were February so it wasn't peak season. <br>The first day we went to go to it, it was closed for filming, not sure what was being filmed but it was closed for the entire day.<br>We went back the next day for a spa session.<br>Like the Szechenyi baths, its a little expensive, about $40 Aud each but when you spends thousands flying from Australia to get to Europe, the cost pails in comparison and you need to spend it as you get an amazing experience.<br>When you walk in, you enter into an amazingly beautiful hall. You pay here and grab your wrist bracelet for the lockers.<br>Getting to the lockers and around the place is a little hard. Its like a maze down under there and can get confusing to move around. That was the only bad point of the experience. The lockers are good, just make sure that it is locked before you leave it.<br>The pools on the inside are very nice and the place is amazingly tiled and it looks lovely. There is a 36 and 40 degree Celsius pool and they are excellent. We spent about an hour in these pools.<br>We then went outside to have a look. The main pool was closed for winter. The outside 36 degree thermal pool was open and it was excellent. It was about 5 degrees Celsius temperature outside and sunny and it was a great variance. I used the sauna and the tepid dunk pool as well. We spent about 2 and half hour out there and when we left, we were thoroughly refreshed.<br>These pools were awesome and we had a great time. I would recommend a morning visit here and its a must do if you want a spa experience.
16;Disappointment;The place is dirty (showers, pools, changing area).<br>No soap in the showers.<br>Rude staff at the information desk!<br>No way to rinse the bench in the steam bath (the shower doesn't reach it properly).<br>Very crowded. Nobody respects the rule of silence, neither at the pool nor in the sauna.<br>Small saunas, of poor quality.
16;Great relaxing time;Relaxing and wonderful time spent.Very easy to be reached by tram or bus.<br>May be much more organisation in locker and shower areas.
16;Big Big disappointment;We went on a particularly warm and sunny day and were looking forward to using the outdoor pools. Having been charged the full price we were particularly disappointed to find that the main outdoor pool was closed ( completely empty and looked like it had been that way for some time judging by the colour of the small amount of water left in the bottom) small pool next to the Sauna was open - no advanced warning main pool was closed ,no reduced rate to offset this - Poor signage - basically left to find your own way around. maybe try the other baths in Budapest?
16;Disappointed;We paid 34¬£ each, the price include  the entry ticket and shower. You need to bring towel flip flop and shampoo or shower cream because even if there are the compartments for it they are empty. We spent 42¬£ for 2 towel and 2 flip flop. the main pool outside was closed, one of the two thermal pool inside was closed as well, steam room was working but the door wasn‚Äôt closed properly so the room was never reaching a decent temperature to sweating. The indoor sauna was not working properly but the one outside was ok. We left after less then 3 hours because of poor choices. I would definitely not suggest to go in this place but instead go in the other around the city which for sure are better than this one. Very very disappointed
16;Scam;Absolute rip off! We had to buy 2 pairs of flip flops and 2 cheap towels for for ‚Ç¨63!!! Left a really bad taste especially after paying ‚Ç¨73 for 2 people to go there! Nowhere does it mention this on the website ! ‚Ç¨63 is an absolute con ! Bring your own towel and flip flops.
16;Dirty;Dirty! Dirty! Dirty! Half of it closed and still charged full money, do not waste ¬£45 going here it is a complete rip off we stayed for 45 minutes, literally like a swimming pool at home only warmer! Try elsewhere!
16;A bit disappointed.;This looks beautiful in the photos and the building is splendid. However, be prepared for this to be very crowded, difficult to navigate your way round, we walked up and down the changing rooms until we found the exit to the pools. We didn't pay for a changing cabin and I wish we had! <br><br>Generally everywhere felt a little grubby. The indoor pools were very busy, didn't seem very clean and smelt very sweaty! <br><br>The outdoor pool (only the small one was open) was better and much more relaxing. <br><br>All in all, the idea of the experience was better than the reality.
17;Great views but citadel closed off for construction;It was a bit disappointing after a 30 minute hike up the hill from the Liberty Bridge end to find that the top where the citadel was closed and you couldn't get around it as it was blocked. There was no signs in the park on the way up noting this. <br>Still, the views from up top were excellent over Budapest. Walking down hill was easier and we found a nice little child's play park on the way down and my wife used the slide to make coming down easier and had a bit of fun as well.<br>It may be a bit difficult for those that have mobility issues due its gradient.
17;Best view of the city!!;What a fun hike!! Given, it‚Äôs a little slippery after the rain, not recommended for people with mobility issues. But you do get a nice viewpoint of the city and all it‚Äôs nice sights. There‚Äôs even a small playground half way up!!! We went when the top of the citadel was closed due to construction so that was a major bummer but the views of the city makes up for it.
17;Excellent view but currently can‚Äôt get to the very top due to construction works;Excellent view but was a bit disappointed to find that after a steep 30 minute hike the monument was closed/blocked off due to construction works. There were no warnings about this at the start (or at any point) of the hike. The view was still worth it though, just don‚Äôt expect to get close to the statue until the construction works are complete.
17;Best view of Budapest;There are two ways to reach top:<br><br>1. You can either walk uphill from liberty bridge that may involve taking lots of steps. There is a children play area on the way 'OR' <br><br>2. you may reach other side of the hill by car or public transport, it will take you to the top. There is a children play area. Thereafter, you will have to track to the top, around 10-15 minutes. The route after reaching top by car/public transport involves steep, flat path, steps. You may consider walking downhill from the other side i.e. towards liberty bridge. <br><br>People with disability or stroller might face difficulties.<br><br>People go to the hill for views of Budapest, its worth it.
17;Worth the walk, but don't get your hopes up;A steady incline walk to the top was greeted by building work and scaffolding, which caused an anti-climax as the monument was not open. It is however, a rewarding experience to reach the (almost) summit and see the skyline view of the city but I would say if you wanted a better higher view and something more to do at the top, you'll have to wait until it's actually open.<br><br>There are no actual directions so just choose a path that suits you as all of them lead to the top.
17;I can see for miles and miles;Well worth the quite steep climb to the top, which is well paved, to take in the beautiful views.  Shame the monument is still shut due to renovations but you can still get quite close to get stunning photos.   No many people here today as it‚Äôs very cold.  You can spend as long as you want admiring the views.  We descended a different path as there are many to choose but you can‚Äôt get lost.
17;Best to visit when cooler.;We had hoped to walk up Gellert Hill, but it was way too hot.  Later we were glad that we had not done the walk as some people we knew said that there had not been as much to see due to repairs being carried out.
17;Citadella Closed;Climbed all the way to the top (in 35oC) to find the Citadella (and the 360 views) currently closed and fenced off. It would have been nice to have had a notice posted, telling us that, at the bottom of the hill.
17;Don‚Äôt Bother;This park is full of trash and graffiti, not to mention the top is fenced off. There are a few cutouts on the way that afford lookouts across the Danube to Pest. Don‚Äôt bother going to the top, the best views are before you get there. Big disappointment, no respect for public spaces.
17;For your typical tourists;The stalls that sell stuffs to tourists is overpriced and run by dishonest vendors. I did not particularly enjoy the views either compared other vantage points of Budapest.
17;Panoramic;To say reaching the top in 30 degrees of afternoon heat and humidity was a trek would be an understatement. To say I was more than delighted that I did, would also be an understatement. The views are spectacular. The views are spectacular. Panoramic. There is an energy about this place that is hard to explain. It almost feels like you become revitalised after every viewing point.
17;A different perspective;It is quite difficult to really understand how beautiful Budapest is whilst in amongst the thick of it. Of course, you get up close to the buildings and then get some wonderful photographs and experience. <br><br>What are you do miss out on is perspective.<br><br>This is where this hill comes into its own. We crossed the bridge to the other side of the city and walked up which we found reasonably easy.<br><br>From here you get amazing views down onto what is one of the most beautiful cities we have visited. You also get some amazing photographs from here!
18;Rude attendant at the entrance.;As we walked from the tram station nearby, we walked around the front to have a look and it was very dirty (trash and graffiti) and it was being cleaned up by a council crew.<br>When we walked up to the entrance and went in, a gentleman attendant was very rude and unhelpful when were trying to enter.<br>We eventually got in and had a quick look. It was nice but I couldn't fully enjoy it due to the poor service of the attendant. When we came out, we left  straight away and didn't go through and have a look at the little shop.
18;A nice break from the heat;We stopped in on a VERY hot day and found refuge in this cave church. The gentlemen manning the desk were so helpful and friendly and the church was beautiful. The gift shop had some cute items as well. We would certainly visit again.
18;Worth a visit;Arrived at 4.55pm ......closed. However mass was on at 5pm. Stayed for the service as Christians. V v special. Thankyou.
18;Nice Stop;Stopped in to check it out and glad we did. A church carved out the cave, there are quite a few things to look at, with different chapels allocated in the space. I especially liked the chapel with the wood carvings. You‚Äôll see it as you cross the Liberty bridge.
18;Very informative and attractive sight.;Very much worth a visit, especially on the way to the Citadel. It is the many statues and other art pieces that are most interesting about the cave.  The audio guide is really great for understanding the art, other artifacts, Hungary's history and the Catholic faith within the country.
18;A Church is a Cave - Wild;This is an impressive tourist stop. A full on church located in the various rooms of a cave. A very unique experience.
18;Chapel, built in hill caves;This is an as explained activity. An interesting audio tour that does not take too long. Worth a call in before walking up the hill
18;A unique church;If you like visiting places that are unique then this is for you. A lovely quaint church built in a cave. Very informative audio guide goes into a lot of detail.
18;Very special.;This might not be the biggest or most opulent tourist attraction you'll visit, but it is truly a hidden gem. <br><br>The audio tour is worth listening to as it gives you a lot of information about the church and its history. <br><br>A very unique and special place.
18;buiilt inside a cave;it is located along the embarkment of danube river. it is a chuch built inside a cave.very natural and artistic.
18;The church cave is worth a visit;We visited the church cave and found it a very pleasant experience - really feeling tempted to just sit down, enjoy and reflect.
18;OK.;Not the most exciting attraction but worth a wander if you‚Äôre in the area. Audio guide. Weird video at the end with interesting choice of soundtrack (I won‚Äôt spoil it).
19;Simply, breathtaking view of the City.;For a great view of Budapest, the visit to this monument is a must.  You can walk (climb) or drive to this location.  Well maintained and clean.
19;A monument from the communist era.;First erected in 1947, it was to commemorate the Soviet troops that liberated Hungary during the war but was later changed to those who sacrificed their lives for independence.  Its on an iconic spot overlooking the city on Gellert hill.<br>It has commanding views over the city and castle hill and is well worth the effort for the views alone.<br>However, the citadel and monument area was under restoration and wasn't accessible for people as it had temporary fencing surrounding it. We couldn't get around it so we had to go down and catch a tram up to the castle along to road by the river.
19;Communist Statue!;The Liberty Statue on Gellert Hill is one of the few prominent Communist statues which remained in situ after the transition to democracy, in part because of its iconic location overlooking the city. The statue was first erected in 1947 to commemorate the Soviet troops who lost their lives liberating the country, however the engraving was later changed so that it commemorated, ‚Äúall who sacrificed their lives for the independence, freedom, and prosperity of Hungary.‚Äù The panoramic views from underneath the statue are unparalleled and help to make the walk to the top of the hill well worth it.
19;Statue under construction, but local Hungarians keep tourists engaged;It'd be really cool trip to hike almost in the city centre. However, it seems that Budapest doesn't really care about the park around the statue. Paths, benches etc. looks like someone has maintained them during USSR times last time. Also I was unlucky to bump into a fence at the top as there are some construction going on. However, at the top I could sit next to a sleeping homeless man and a gang of middle aged Hungarians with huge bellies that were scamming tourists in the game of three cups. I'd say that it was a truly Hungarian experience ;)
19;Closed for 2022;The area of Citadel and Liberty statue is closed due to reconstruction for 2022. You can still go around.
19;–ù–∞ —Ä–µ–∫–æ–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ü–∏–∏ / under reconstruction;–Ø–Ω–≤–∞—Ä—å 2022, —Å—Ç–∞—Ç—É—è –∏ —Ü–∏—Ç–∞–¥–µ–ª—å –Ω–∞ —Ä–µ–∫–æ–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ü–∏–∏, –ø–æ–¥–æ–π—Ç–∏ –Ω–µ–ª—å–∑—è. –•–æ—Ç—è –ø–æ –ø—É—Ç–∏ –Ω–∞—Å–ª–∞–¥–∏–ª–∏—Å—å –≤–∏–¥–∞–º–∏ –ü–µ—à—Ç–∞, January 2022, the statue and the citadel are under reconstruction, it is impossible to approach.  Although along the way we enjoyed the views of Pest,
19;Read the History of the Monument;Sitting atop Gellert Hill, it can be seen from throughout the town and is impressive at night. Read up on the change from the Soviet era to the current version of the statue.
19;Nice views, impressive statue;It's a huge statue of Liberty. The view here are nice. It's visible from across the city. What else can I say? You will most probably come here anyway if you visit Budapest as the Citadel(la) hill is very beautiful and pleasing to walk around with lots of sights.
19;Over looking the city;Located on Gell√©rt Hill, stands this monument, erected in 1947, was originally dedicated to the Soviet Liberation During WWII, nowadays, it represents a memorial of all Hungarians that have fallen for the freedom of Hungary.
19;A nice statue;Besides rewarding views of the city and the surrounding area on top of Gellert Hill, you will come across this Liberty Statue.  It is a nice statue and suits the scenery very well.  It honors those who fought and died for freedom in Hungary's history.
19;Commemorates those who sacrificed their lives for Hungary;Liberty Statue (a.k.a.or Freedom Statue or Szabads√°g-szobor) is a monument at the top of Gell√©rt Hill commemorating those who sacrificed their lives for the independence, freedom, and prosperity of Hungary.  It was erected in 1947 in remembrance of the Soviet liberation of Hungary during World War II, ending the occupation by Nazi Germany.  The 14m bronze statue (by Hungarian Zsigmond Kisfaludi Str√≥bl) stands atop a high pedestal. a woman with upraised arms holds a large palm leaf, symbolizing peace. On either side of the base are male figures on smaller pedestals: a triumphant figure holds a torch (representing progress), and a second depicts a man fighting a mythical creature (representing evil).  In the years after 1947, Hungarians regarded the Soviets less as liberators and more as oppressors.  The statue was partially damaged during the 1956 Hungarian uprising.   After the 1989 transition from communist rule to democracy, the original inscription was modified to read: "To the memory of those all who sacrificed their lives for the independence, freedom, and prosperity of Hungary", and a Russian version was removed.  The statue of a soldier holding a Soviet flag (originally at the base) was banished to Memento Park (a sculpture park with Communist-era statues  on the outskirts of the city).  Liberty statue is a good place to watch sunrise and sunset. it is beautifully lit at night.  Several paved footpaths (stairs and streetlights) ascend the hill, offering panoramic views over the Danube, Elizabeth and Szabadsag bridges, Pest, and the hills beyond.  Sturdy shoes and water are recommended if you ascend on foot.  Liberty Statue is accessible at all times with no entry fee.
19;romantic!;it's the most beautiful view of the Budapest. very romantic place with a stunning view!!! but...it is too high to walk it and yes there is NO lift, you have to walk it. also if you go at night as we did get a torch you'll need it!
20;"The tour has to be booked by email in advance and is free of charge. I turned out to be the only visitor and it resulted in an amazing almost 3 hours long private tour (I guess it can be shorter if requested). The guide was extremely enthusiastic and shared lots of curious details about the building history, the geological collection and people related to the institute. It was one of the most memorable tours I ever had in Budapest, highly recommend! P.S. Just wait for the guide in the main entrance hall. The gatekeeper did not speak English at all and I felt a bit confused whether I should stay there or go somewhere further.";
20;Beautiful externally, but unable to visit inside as it is by appointment only and there is a long waiting list as they don't have regular guides. So warning don't follow incorrect information on websites. However, l would still recommend you come and admire.;
20;This is the Hungarian Geological Institute building, designed by the great √ñd√∂n Lechner who is credited as being the father of Hungarian Art Nouveau. He has several outstanding buildings situated around Budapest and different parts of Europe. Im not sure what the schedule is, but I was able to email then and get a tour of the building with a group of students.  Our guide did a really great job and was enthusiastic about what he was showing us, even though his true passion are rocks and minerals and not architecture. I really enjoyed being shown around the building and given some of its history, they say it is one of the best preserved original structures by Lechner. You know you are getting close to the building when you look up and see the blue tile roof with the incredible world globe being held up by 4 men. Such a great building!!;
20;Beautiful building, and wonderful guided visit to the building and the collection. Note that it is not a museum so you have to book an appointment. It is really worth. Our guide was really inspiring!;
20;Building is incredible. We got a personal tour around the institute (booked in advance and the only way to get in) which included seeing their collection. Going on to the roof is a must do - great view of the city too.;
20;Bautiful palace. It's should renovate a little.;
20;Fabulous building, soon to be World Heritage?;
20;Beautiful building and awesome inside;
20;Really cool building!;
20;Friendly museu;
21;Scam and tourist trap - avoid the langos stall;The market is really bad, there are a total of 3 food stalls and they are tourist traps. The langos stall in particular is absolutely awful, it‚Äôs a massive tourist scam, you will get ripped off - I‚Äôm surprised they haven‚Äôt been shut down for fraud. <br><br>The place is a massive massive scam, avoid at all costs. If you search the langos stall on google reviews you‚Äôll see 100s of people who have been scammed like us. <br><br>You will order an item for 5000ft and end up getting charged 20000FT (40 eur) because they‚Äôve added extra toppings. <br><br>They also charge for things like the cardboard plate and cutlery without explaining. <br><br>Every single sauce you have is an extra 500FT<br><br>The rest of Budapest is cheap, we ended up paying 50EUR for two langos at this matket, which are basically two tiny pizzas.
21;Ignore the bad reviews, go and visit it;I was a bit wary of going to this place due to seeing a lot of bad reviews. We were pleasantly surprised , the place has three floors which sell various items. Lots of souvenir shops, fruit and vegetable stalls, butchers and restaurants. The sellers are not pushy in any way and the majority of the stalls have price of the item indicated. They accept card payments. The hall is clean and tidy and has toilets facilities which you have to pay to use. Really enjoyed our time there and got the correct change when purchasing items.
21;Huge indoor market;Huge place. Downstairs are market stalls for meat, veg and everything paprika based. Upstairs are textiles and some food vendors. It was very busy and food difficult to get near. Overall a nice place to wander around but a bit repetitive and priced at the tourist market. <br>
21;Tourist trap;Tourist trap.. very few locals, certainly none eating upstairs due to the extremely inflated prices. One Langos and a beer cost me AUD$39. The fruit and veg were just horrible.. wrinkly old peppers, I bought supremely better at the local Spar supermarket. The souvenir shops upstairs claiming their goods were made by women in the Hungarian country side, quite honestly, given every store (around<br>50 of them!) had exactly the same stuff, my guess it‚Äôs made in China. Give this place a big miss!
21;Not worth the visit;Read reviews about ‚Ä¶some good abc some bad‚Ä¶thought I would  give it a visit. <br>Many booths sells same types of good. <br>Sellers not friendly on the most part. <br>There are some quick bite restaurants on the second floor which did not really look appealing. <br>Could not wait to leave. It was a total waste of time. <br>My recommendation: Skip it
21;Enjoyable visit;Great market, vibrant and very colourful. Lots to see and great food upstairs. We tried a Hungarian taster dish which was delicious. Enjoyed our visit
21;Price scam at 2nd floor restaurants;Check other reviews here and on Google. Second floor restaurants purposely scam tourist and take advantage of no Hungarian speakers. Not mentioned deposits are added and in the end they charge you as much as they want. Very dishonest! We ended up paying almost 50 euros for some rice, Gulasch, a sausage and 2 beers. Be aware!
21;Better for locals than tourists;Wasn‚Äôt what we expected. We got there at 08:30am thinking it wouldn‚Äôt be too busy as opened at 06:00am but loads of places were shut and only just opening. Wasn‚Äôt really worth going but I image it‚Äôs good if you live locally as lots of fresh fruit, veg and meat
21;Good food but watch out for extra charges and over crowding;Great food, had the Hungarian sausage and L√°ngos. Both great, however watch out for extra charges as it can mount up. Sausage was probably one of the best I have ever had, great use of paprika. However quite over crowded but good for some shopping.
21;Let down;I was most excited to visit here but was completely let down. There's tonnes of fresh fruit stands and meat stalls and upstairs clothes and bags. There must've been 2/3 food stalls and a restaurant which were completely busy and food had been sat in the open all day. The whole place was completely overwhelming and overcrowded. Got a fruit pot for extortionate price that wasn't very nice.
22;Best spot for the view and ambiance;For me the most exciting bridge of Budapest, best to be enjoyed when sun goes down, youths gather there to have a drink together, climbing on the structure.
22;Excellent bridge. Nicely lit at night as well.;This bridge was lovely both in day and night.<br>It has some beautiful birds on that are from the Turel bird of Hungarian legends / lore. Built as part of the Millennium World Exhibition at the end of the 19th century, the bridge features art nouveau design, mythological sculptures and the country's coat of arms adorned on its side.<br>Its the shortest bridge over the River Danube.<br>We caught the tram over it from outside the Central market and also from the tram stop under Gellert hill.
22;Bridge with Historic Icons;This bridge has some notable elements to it and is great for pics from above - i.e. across on the Buda side from up the hill. The bird statues on the bridge are models of the Turul bird from legends of Hungarian lore. There's also the Hungarian coat of arms prominently displayed. Nice bridge to see and drive/walk over. Just avoid being a lame tourist and attaching a lock to the bridge - it's tacky and unless you're from Budapest it leaves another task for city workers as they eventually have to cut off the locks. Respect the site.
22;Shortest in Budapest;Liberty Bridgeis known as Freedom Bridge and connects Buda and Pest which located inbetween  the River Danube and is green in colour. <br><br>It is the shortest bridge in Budapest's city centre.. <br><br>This bridge was the first rebuilt in Budapest after World War II.
22;The Iron Lady!;Great old Iron bridge. built near the end of the 1800s,  Great views from the bridge and the structure itself is fabulous.  Pedestrian walkways on both sides of the bridge. Beautifully lit at night, accents the light green color of the bridge.
22;Leave a lock;One of the 3 major bridges in Budapest linking Buda to Pest, we wandered on for a stroll and attached a lock where we found a few others on the bridge.<br>Great photo opportunity and close to the Grand Market.
22;A Bridge;It's an iron bridge over the River Danube,painted green,seperate walkways protect pedestrians from the traffic as they cross the river.<br>       Built in the late 19th century was originally named Franz Joseph Bridge and runs from the Great Market Square on the Buda side to the base of Gellert Hill on the Pest side.<br>       You can get some great photos of the towns from here.
22;The green bridge!;Going fro Buda to Pest and back we had walked over this bridge several times. Offers great view of the river and the city ( both banks of the city).
22;Lovely Bridge;Loved this area and bridge.  Up there with tower bridge and the Charles bridge in Prague.  Still not as good as the Tyne Bridge but what is. ‚Ä¶.
22;Not just a bridge;this is not just a bridge, it looks very cool and you can walk safely away from the cars. Just look out  for cyclists!
22;Crossing the Danube;Well, it is a bridge, it is green, tourists like to climb on it and it connects Buda to Pest. Although I like to read up on things it seems thay Budapest is happy for its tourism industry to rely on drunk stag and hen parties. The artistic, historic and architectural beauty is ruined by limosines full of bellends
22;An attractive art nouveau design bridge across the River Danube.;We stayed quite near this lovely bridge when spending several days in Budapest.  The bridge was built between 1894 and 1896 featuring art nouveau design and is 333.6m in length and 20.1m wide. The top of the four masts are decorated with large bronze statues of the Turul, a falcon-like bird which is prominent in ancient Hungarian mythology.  The bridge had to be rebuilt in 1945 after World War 2.<br>We walked over the bridge during the day from Buda to Pest and it offers great views of the River Danube and both sides of the City.  Trams, cars and pedestrians use the bridge.  It looks great illuminated at night and would make a nice spot for a romantic walk.  When walking the bridge look for the small old man in a boat sculpture that is locked to the bridge railings (See my photos to understand what you are looking for) he is on the right-hand side railings as you walk from Buda towards Pest.
23;The "Garden of Philosophy" is a must see!;The Mucsarnok is a beautiful art museum on the Hero's Square. It is a neo-classical building inside and out.   My absolute favorite part was the "Garden of Philosophy" exhibit.   It is an eight-figure sculpture placed at the focus of the exhibition.   The sculptures were 3-D printed!
23;Nice stairs;Looks nice from the outside. I've never been inside. However, the stairs are a pretty good place to sit and rest.
23;A great looking building;Located right across from Heroes Square this is fantastic looking building that displays works of modern Hungarian and International Artists. <br><br>You can't miss it when you visit Heroe's Square. <br><br>Worth entering for any exhibition. I liked it very much
23;Graceful neo-Classical palace with contemorary art exhibits;The Palace of Exhibitions (Mucsarnok) is a contemporary art museum on the southeast side of Hero's Square.  The neo-Classical building (architects Albert Schickedanz and F√ºl√∂p Herczog)  was completed in 1896 for the millennium celebrations.  Standing in Hero's Square, I admired its graceful Greek Revival portico: six columns surmounted by a pediment with a colorful mosaic of St. Istvan (the patron saint of fine art).  Inside, large exhibition rooms were decorated in neo-Classical style, with tall ceilings and soft light from skylights.  The Palace of Exhibitions is run by the Hungarian Academy of Arts. it does not have a permanent collection.  It offers temporary exhibits of contemporary Hungarian and international fine art (check the web site for what is current ).  The palace has a bookshop, library, and the M≈±csarnok Caf√© overlooking the square.  The building is beautifully it at night.   The Palace of Exhibitions is open 10am to 6pm daily Tues to Sun, except Thurs, noon to 8pm, with an entry fee of 800 HUF (discount for students, educators, senior citizens ).
23;Note: No permanent collection;The Palace of arts next to Heroes Square is a gorgeous building - it is important to note that it has no permanent exhibitions. So, what it there to see will always be changing. The building itself is not terribly large, so if what is currently on exhibition is of interest, you could probably see it in less than a couple of hours.
23;The displays were ok but not my kind of art;We brought Budapest cards so we could access most visitors sights. The displays were all photographs which wasn‚Äôt to my taste. But that‚Äôs the beauty of art we all like different. The ballet display was nice and the photographs were very clear. Staff were unhelpful and rude. I wouldn‚Äôt go back as the displays were very small.
23;Interesting exhibition;I visited this museum as it was included in Budapest card. The exhibition was interesting, but I expected more art.
23;Boring as hell;We expected actual art but the whole museum had nothing of interest and no art. It was very boring and also not as big as it looks from the outside. Don‚Äôt go here, such a waste of money.
23;A feast for the eyes;The exhibits are examples of objects made by masters of old crafts, many of them are a modern twist on old skills so they could absolutely be incorporated into the modern home / contemporary fashion. Everything can be found here from furniture, clothes, everyday objects, instruments to jewelery, including crafts like woodcarving, weaving, embroidery, felting, leathercrafting, pottery... Definitely worth a visit for the art enthusiasts.
23;A pleasant surprise not seen by many;While visiting Hero‚Äôs square on a Hop on Hop off sightseeing tour  bus, we noticed the Palace of Exhibitions (Mucsarnok), a graceful building opposite the Museum of Fine Arts (Sz√©pm√ºv√©szeti Museum), on the other side of the square. The Palace of Exhibitions was built in the eclectic-neoclassical style between 1900 and 1906 from the plans of Albert Schickedanz and F√ºl√∂p Herzog.<br>It an interesting building with no real permanent exhibitions, it seems that different artists showing their work with government support. Some of the pieces were really beautiful and very different.  <br>  The Entrance fee was only $8:00, and it also made nice shady break from the warm sun. We stayed a little longer and caught a later Hop on Hop bus.<br>TIP: We strongly recommend this bus tour, as it gives you a complete over view of the city‚Äôs sights.
23;Great temporary exhibitions;My boyfriend and I visited the museum in September last year. We were lucky to see an exhibitions of Sebastian Salgado's images and Jozef Suchoza artworks - both exhibitions were stunning! Because the exhibitions are changed relatively often, I would recommend checking the museum's website before visiting. However, basing on what we saw, Mucsarnok is successful at creating well-curated, modern exhibitions. Must-see for any contemporary art lover!
23;European Tour.;We were looking for a museum to go to Budapest on our free day. We come across the Mucsarnok, looked very nice form the outside. In side the exhibition was on local culture from all over Hungary. All we can say it was breathtaking. What we learnt about costume, pottery, dance and tradition. We done Budapest.
24;Great museum with a range of displays;Came here for a Bosch exhibition, and was not disappointed. In addition to the Bosch displays, there was a wonderful range of art work from a range of timeframes to enjoy. A must visit when in Budapest.
24;Great collection;If you are into paintings this is the place to be! Such a beatiful collection. We spend about 2.5 hours in the museum but could not see it all. The collection is nicely organized by style/country and period. Dont miss out on the great pieces by Cranach and Rafael.
24;Beautiful;Beautiful Egyptian and Greek collection underground in a beautiful building. The museum is beautifully arranged. There is a free cloakroom. Unfortunately, I didn't have the energy to see the rest of the museum but it seems to me that it would have been worth it. Overall, great experience. Free with the Budapest card.
24;very interesting;the building itself is very impressive. The collection is very interesting and worth a visit. the facilites are also excellent with a very clean and organised cloakroom and toilets. The bar and restaurant are very clearly marked for allergies and quality of food is excellent.
24;For art sake!;The museum is located adjacent to the Heroes Square and is a grand structure in its own right. We didn't have time to enjoy the exhibitions, but the building itself is a work of art.
24;RUDE STAFF;Men at entrance  VERY RUDE.  NO access to  Cafe or washrooms after spending over 100EUROs in the shop. Not helpful or even  polite.
24;My favorite art place in Budapest üá≠üá∫;The Museum of Fine Arts Budapest is Hungary's largest and finest art museum. Its collection includes thousands of artwork from prehistory to the present. Old master paintings (13th to 18th centuries) was my favorite containing over 3000 paintings in the collection. If you enjoy art and paintings, make sure you allocate 3-5 hours to this museum. Felt that the Fine Arts Museum was above the Hungarian National Gallery in terms of display of art, more organized and the visit was more structured. This museum was my number 1 most enjoyed experience in Budapest. Entry price: 11EUR
24;Bosch exhibition;One of our main goals of visiting Budapest was the Bosch exhibition. It was an extra, that we could watch all exhibitions with the Bosch ticket, so we took the chance. It's a great building with lots to see, we seen hours here. Even the building itself worths a visit. There are many artifacts here from different eras of history. If someone likes arts they should certainly spend some time here.
24;Rude staff which do not speak English. Silly security rules.;The staff are all elderly and none speak English! Whether you bought a ticket online for a specific time is irrelevant to them, you have to queue anyway. If you have a bag it needs to be searched. After searching, it still needs to be deposited in the cloakroom. What is the point of that? If you get too close to the paintings, the staff give you a rude telling off in Hungarian, despite there being no signs stating in English how close you can get to the paintings.
24;Nice Visit;It‚Äôs a very good Art Museum - not great. If you like religious themes, you‚Äôll love it as that seems to be the emphasis. We went for the Bosch exhibit which was also very good - not great. We walked here from the city center in about an hour. Kind of confusing to track rooms you‚Äôve visited, but after a while, the art seemed all the same to me. Next to Heroes Plaza added to trip worthiness.
24;A first class art museum;A first class art museum. Great orientation for guests from abroad. Beautiful premises. The Bosch temporary exhibition was fabulous, with precious art and good documentation. The permanent collection has a few highlights that should not be missed. The panel describing these in the entry hall is worth consulting. As an advice - book tickets in advance to avoid the lines.
24;Badly Organised;Bought a ticket line for the Permanent Collection and had to wait 1 hour outside in the sun.<br>What‚Äôs the point of buying a ticket in advance when people who arrive after you without a ticket get in before you.<br>Once inside the art is fabulous, hardly anyone inside‚Ä¶they‚Äôre all queuing outside.<br>You should have 2 lines one for people with Hieronymus Bosch Tickets and one for people who have tickets for the permanent collection.<br>Won‚Äôt return.
25;<span>Learn more</span> about animal welfare in tourism;Fabulous park. Well worth a walk round..
25;Fabulous park, open air swimming pools massive! Water slides, Spa baths. Mini zoo statues about every 100yards. Running track sports arena. The list goes on. Lovely well kept gardens grass area to sit and picnic. Several cafe and bars kept to just one area. If you wanted there were peddle bikes or electric cars, and regular bikes to hire.<br>   Just a lovely place to spend a leisurely sunny day. A tad disappointed sat for 25 minutes to see and hear the music  fountain supposed to on the hour, it didn't!;Nice park but pools undergoing maintenance and take your own towels!
25;Firstly I enjoyed the green space, peace and quiet after the busy city of Budapest.  However, if you go to Budapest you know it's a busy city so maybe needing some space is a contradiction!  If you have small children that have tired of the sights I would definitely recommend it to let them round around freely for a few hours.<br><br> My big disappointment were the pools.  Only a very small section are open but you don't know this until you have paid full price and gone inside.  Regarding the towels - I had read on a website that they were provided but they are available to PURCHASE - not rent or lend.  They were really expensive (I think about 40 Euros each).   We had chosen to visit these pools as opposed to any other as I thought it would be nice to experience them in a park but from what I understand the main ones in town are better.;Get out of the city without going anywhere
25;We were a little early in the season for the gardens and restaurants to be in full swing.  It is a nice green space to get out of the city without having to get out of the city.  The ruins of the old church and convent are an interesting view into Budapest's past.  The quaint little free zoo on the island was a fun addition to our quick visit, nothing too outstanding but a nice way to get up close to some wildlife. I wish we could have been there to see the Japanese garden in full glory, but even for early spring it was a relaxing and beautiful place.  The biggest negative to the island is the horrendous eyesore of a hotel/spa at the far end (opposite Margit bridge) of the Island.  All in all, I would highly recommend getting away from the hubbub of the city and spend an afternoon in the middle of the Danube.;Calm and peaceful place
25;Really lovely and peaceful place. Wonderful if you are lucky like we were and the weather was gorgeous. No traffic so very calming and relaxing. Avoid the Steg Pub as this is a hostel pub so loads of stag dos there when we went.;Island life
25;Nice island on the Danube, good for a walk, and take in the views, nice cafes, quiet with little traffic access;Good filler activity
25;<span>Learn more</span> about animal welfare in tourism;My most favorite place in Budapest
25;Margaret Island is an island in the middle of the Danube River.  It can be access at the middle of the Margaret Bridge.  It is actually a huge garden with free entrance.  There is a running / walking path along the river but not sure if it is around the whole island as we walk along just the path facing the Pest side.  <br><br>There are some cafes and restaurants.  However some were not open early in the morning when we were there.  There are some toilets (you have to pay) but they were all closed at that time.  The best bat is go to one of those restaurant to eat and use their;Biggest Green Oasis!
25;Margaret Island is Budapest‚Äôs biggest green oasis ‚Äì accessible by foot from the middle of the Margaret Bridge. The whole island is a huge park home to a Medieval Church ruin, a lovely Japanese garden, century-old towering trees and endless picnics.  The centerpiece is a large fountain that lights up and ‚Äúdances‚Äù to music every hour from spring to winter ‚Äì the 9 pm show is enhanced with a multimedia screening that displays images of Hungary‚Äôs greats projected onto a water curtain.  The Margaret Island park‚Äôs fountain actually plays a coordinated musical show every hour from 11 am, but the best time to visit is for the final, much longer show at 9 pm. You‚Äôll be treated to a choreographed fountain, light, and music show set to popular songs from a variety of genres. It‚Äôs a great, free thing to do in Budapest at night (or, if you opt for the day show, to combine with a stroll around the park).;Lots to see and do
25;We walked the length of the island enjoying the Japanese Garden and views of Buda and Pest. Easy to get to on public transit. We also had our first Langos on the trip. Wandered the Dominican convent ruins.;Wonderful
25;Doing a boat trip along the Danube River we stopped off at Margarets Island for a visit after being mentioned by one of the boat guys ...and glad we did...The island is small but so beautiful, abundance with trees, flowers , green oasis, different gardens and a park and pathway I so much loved. Never stopped for drink or food at the  bars but quite happily stood and listened to the large musical fountain until was time to catch our boat back.. A Lovely place for picnics or just some peace n quiet if that's what you looking for!  Loved it !!!!;Nice Island
25;We cruised around the island as part of a Danube Sightseeing Cruise. Looks a nice enough Island, quite large for walking. The cruise allows you to get off at the island and get a later cruise back if you wish. The Margaret Island bridge is also impressive;Lovely park, let down by a very rude staff member!

27;Just go;Forget the negative comments in some other reviews, this is a first class museum. Very clear exhibits and well laid out that demonstrate the depth of history and culture of the region. So interesting, my wife and I spent two days there (about 10 hours in all) and still didn‚Äôt see it all in the detail we would have liked. We will go again next time we visit Budapest.
27;Disappointing;Get rid of all the staff. They are extremely rude and unhelpful. It felt like a work creation scheme. Lots of staff standing around chatting and ignoring the customers.
27;Chronological display of artefacts in need of coherent plain spoken narrative.;Needs a narrative, and a modern remake.  The items on permanent display quite good and well presented and labelled in Magyar and English.  However there‚Äôs very little historical narrative other than 500 to 1000 words for each half century or so in 20 sections.  They really need to update it with some modern museum expertise.  Otherwise it‚Äôs mostly set of artefacts laid out in chronological order.  It‚Äôs hard to find the permanent exhibit too amongst the temporary exhibits.  The narrative historical text in the great synagogue is much better.
27;Average;The museum staff was friendly but most of them hardly speak english language. Also at the ticket office the young man gave us the strange look when we wished to buy only tickets for the War is over! exhibition - they had lots of tickets for everything, too expensive for us to see all.
27;Great visit, well worth it;Fantastic museum would recommend a visit. Great range of exhibits with a lovely cafe and facilities.
27;A must!;It is a must to see activity while staying in Budapest. <br>The Coronation Mantle is just over the top. Also, when you see the Seuso Treasure you will be spechless. <br>There are also several interesting exhibitions. If you like history devote at least 1 hour for the Hungarian National Museum.
27;Most disabled-unfriendly museum I have ever visited;What really interests me about Hungary is that their language is not slavic like those in neighbouring countries. It is more related to Finnish or Sami.<br>I have a slipped disc and use sticks to walk. It is painful to stand for too long and stairs are very painful. I could not have picked a worse place to visit.<br>The entry is via a flight of 30 steps to the front door. To leave your coat in the cloakroom you then have to descend a spiral set of stairs. I asked if there was a lift. The answer was it was only for staff. I was led there by a member of staff up a small flight of steps and then down another flight.<br>I then had to go up in the lift again to get to the archaeological exhibition, which was up a flight of steps! In the exhibition, there was no space to sit, which meant standing to a long time to read the boards.<br>After an hour of discomfort, I was unable to see any other sections of the museum and left.<br>Although the EU has laws about disabled access, it does not seem to have reached Hungary yet.
27;Nice little hour passed;Worth a visit and a lot to see. Variety of things to see so was interesting throughout and to see the history of Hungary and learn a bit more about the country. Decent price also to get in was around ¬£5 each. We walked here took around 17min not sure how easy it is to get to in transport.
27;Horrible cold place.;Awful. Terribly signed posted inside and terrible for children. <br><br>Cold and rude staff, constantly snapping at my three year old for even going close to the glass cabinets. Constant dirty looks as we entered the room from staff. Wouldn‚Äôt step foot in there again. Such a shame as the exhibitions were interesting.
27;Shocking appalling;Shocking experience. We didn‚Äôt see any exhibitions. We got sold a student ticket that‚Äôs only valid for Hungarian and eu people, even after he asked where we are from and I said that we are English he still sold me the ticket even though it‚Äôs not valid. The guards didn‚Äôt let us even enter any rooms before kicking us out as our ticket wasn‚Äôt valid for us ‚Äúenglish‚Äù people. Very discriminatory. Also walked in with many bags and was then told to leave the room as we have bags. Very weird experience and just left out of disgust.. never returning and don‚Äôt go if you are english! Clearly a Hungarian only musuem. Rude staff
27;Incredible museum;I have been to many museums but this one really struck me as special. The exhibits were very explanatory and the artifacts were in incredible condition. Highly recommend
27;Interesting but not very welcoming;The museum itself contains a wealth of interesting objects and displays, including but not limited to - a piano played by both Beethoven and Liszt, the glasses and prison cell door of Imre Nagy and a reconstruction of Janos Kadar's office.<br><br>However, some of the museum staff were rather rude and unhelpful and the museum itself isn't very well laid out. <br><br>Also, you have to purchase a special photo ticket in order to take any photos, but you aren't actually informed of this when buying your ticket. Fortunately for me, only a guard about halfway through our time in the museum actually cared to enforce this so we were able to take photos up until then.
28;Ironic balance of monuments;Very interesting square with a wide variety of memorials and monuments. Surprised to see a statue of Presidents Bush and Reagan across from one dedicated to Soviet Soldiers. Then down the way is another dedicated to the Holocaust. It was a pretty park with a blend of monuments which all had a different angle to history.
28;Nice area;Nice and large park area close to The Danube and Parliament Building. Lots of benches to sit and enjoy the day. Surrounded by some beautiful buildings. Lots of renovation with going on currently in this area.
28;It will soon turn into the 2nd Memento Park.;It is deeply symbolic that the first known building on the current Freedom Square was at the end of the XVIII century a prison in which captured officers of the French Revolutionary Army were held. For this reason, the building was named the Hungarian Bastille. After the revolution took place in Hungary in 1848-1849, fighters for independence were held here. Lajos Battiani, the first prime minister of Hungary, was executed here. This building has not been preserved. The beautiful mansions around the perimeter of the square belong to the Secession era (the Austrian name for Art Deco). The Palace of the Stock Exchange and the National Bank of Hungary was designed by Alpar Ignac, the architect of the Vaidahunyad Castle. The beautiful square was disfigured under the Horthy dictatorship. A bunch of different sculptures with pompous and exalted names were installed on it: Hungarian Resurrection or Hungarian Pain. The only surviving statue belongs to the American general-occupier of the Philippines Bandholtz, who prevented the Romanians from robbing the Hungarian museum in 1919. Residents of Baghdad are probably surprised here that there were American generals in history who did not rob museums, but prevented it... After the Communists came to power in 1945, the statue of the stocky general was dragged to the American embassy, which it pleased with its modest artistic merits until the end of the 80s. It was dragged back to the square in 1989 for the arrival of President George Bush. Not the one who thought Slovakia and Slovenia were the same country, but his dad Bush Sr. The Elder Bush himself stands in stone here. The authorities of the capital added a third American to it - Ronald Reagan in 2011. To his centenary. As I understand it, we should expect lovelace Clinton, Nobel Prize winner Obama and Trump and Biden.. The current government is not as friendly with the Americans as the previous ones, so in 2019 they inaugurated a monument to the victims of the German invasion. The monument is accused of suppressing Hungary's role in World War II and genocide. All the arguments against are located next to the monument. The dominant feature of the square is an obelisk to the soldiers of the Red Army who died during the capture of Budapest. The assault cost the Red Army dearly and initially there was a mass grave here, which was later moved. This is the only Soviet monument in Budapest that was not moved to the Memento Park. However, judging by the dynamics of the placement of large and small (Tiny Hidden Statues are still there) monuments, nothing will need to be moved. There will be no fewer monuments here...
28;Full of Historical Monuments;This park is just a short walk from the Parliament Buildings and offers much to see. There are many monuments, memorials, and statues in this small area that commemorate both the good and the bad of Hungarian and European history. <br><br>In this area you will see two American Presidents, and a General who played an important part in Hungary‚Äôs history.
28;Chock Full of Budapest History;If you love being outside or love historical monuments, this is your place. "Freedom Square" (as some locals call it) is a great place to hang out and experience what the locals do for outdoor entertainment. You will likely find a "flea market" type of vibe, with many local artisans selling their handmade wares. The historical significance is impressive. Just a few steps from each other, you will find monuments dedicated to the Soviets and two American Presidents, Ronald Reagan and George Bush. Be sure and allocate some time to visit here. You will not be disappointed.
28;Square;Beautiful square close to the Parlament. Statues of US presidents and Soviet troops in it. Great spot to take a walk, sit down and enjoy the weather
28;Square with memorials.;We walked through this square, park area, on the way to parliament. There are memorials to holocaust victims and lots of grassed areas. There is a coffee shop in the centre and plenty of restaurants close by. A nice area.
28;This square touched my heart;Szabadsag Ter ("Liberty Square") is one of Budapes't most genteel and inviting public space. The first person you'll see as you enter the square is the statue of Mr. Ronald Reagan. He is respected in Hungary for his role as a Cold Warrior. It's fun to watch the steady stream of passerby, both Hungarians and tourists, do a double-take, chuckle, then snap a photo with the Gipper. <br><br>Next - walk around the stout obelisk to the center of the square. This is the Soviet War Memorial, commemorating "Liberation Day" : April 4,1945, when the Soviets officially forced the Nazis out of Hungary. <br><br>What's else we can see in this leafy huge square? The Square ringed by both sides by fancy old apartments blocks (typical of high-class townhouses from Budapest's Golden Age  in the late 1800s) and important buildings such as the former Hungarian State Television headquarters, the US Embassy, and the National Bank of Hungary. <br><br>But the most memorable part of this park is the monument to the Hungarian victims of the Nazis. This is a rather large area covered with variable pop-up fountains, where adults and children enjoy life and nice weather getting joy of the water and  take pictures. Behind the fountains is an obelisk with a proud eagle and photographs of the victims of the Nazis. This is a very touching place. It's nice to just sit here keeping silence and respect.
28;Fun and sadness;Lovely park with memorials. Couldn't help but notice that while children played in the dancing fountains, feet away, holocaust familes paid respect to those who they lost in WW2 with a beautiful and poignant memorial to their loved ones.
28;a small square where the conflict and contratdiction of the past century is spelled out in stone and statuary;We see monuments and statues lauding the Red Army for defeating the Germans (even though the Hungarians supported the Nazis for most of the war) , ultimately honoring Ronald Reagan for doing and saying the things that truly liberated Hungary. Lot of geopolitical statements made here and it is a fascinating and provocative place. Close to the center of things in Pest and between the Parliament Building at the Basilica it is well worth a short visit.
28;Square with various monuments;This is a small grassy square not far from the Danube, but still a ltitle off the tourist track and so perfect for a sit down to pass the time and explore the dfifferent monuments and features which depict various stages of Hungarian history. At ist heart is a large fountain which will appeal to families and there are plemty of cafes nearby.
28;Huge park and square, with anchoring monuments.;Large park, with two memorable monuments at each end: Monument to Soviet Red Army and Memorial for Victims of German Occupation.
29;Opportunity Lost to Expand Understanding of Jewish History in Europe;Without a doubt, this is one of the most spectacular examples of synagogue architecture in Europe. And the museum collection is amazing. However, at 9000 HUF (about USD 27) per person, the experience is out of reach of many and dissuades those who might not be specifically interested but open to learn about this important history. It is true that the synagogue is generally crowded but he crowds are older and not representative of the new generations of people, many of whom know little or nothing about the Holocaust. The entire experience left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.
30;Didn‚Äôt stay;Underwhelming area, visited to attend Christmas market as recommended. Greeted on arrival by a man exposing himself and urinating in the middle of the street. Graffiti everywhere, didn‚Äôt stay!
30;Pretty suburb of Budapest;Just a few train stops on the outside of Budapest , i found this charming suburb, a quaint atmosphere, it has many beautiful buildings a museum and Christmas markets one of five best in Budapest recommended to me.<br>It is on the same suburban train line as Szentendre and tickets are free to Obuda with the Budapest 7 day travel ticket.<br>Aquincum is close by with Roman ruins.
30;hidden tressure of budapest;this is a area if you are in Budapest and want to og away from tourist area i will recommend highly<br>its many hidden beautiful buildings<br>funny statues of woman With umbrella<br>beautiful old square With a pink Palace hidden away into a gate<br>Zichy Palace<br>a beautiful nonnery yellow colour same as Church<br>and Nice house museum gyula krudy<br>and we finished With fantastic Food at a restaurant beside Church<br>this was a wonderful visit to obuda<br>this is a hidden diamant of an area of Budapest<br>i loved it
30;Spend sometime just wondering around here;Visited on Sunday 8th October. We were on a guided tour and our tour guide took us for a walk around this very historic area of the city. Not to be missed, just make sure you allow yourself enough time to see everything there.
30;Too much for a day.;After reading the reviews, your feeling is, that only the Roman Amphitheater is worth seeing in √ìbuda. But √ìbuda offers a lot of interesting and beautiful sights. Let's start with the Memorial of the Katyn Martyrs, which is just a few steps away from the Amphitheater and the tram stops right in front of it. <br>The majority of the attractions are in and around the Main Square (F≈ë t√©r) and the Holy Spirit Square ( Szentl√©lek t√©r).My advice to go by HEV5 to Szent L√©lek Square station, and from there just walk. Of course, buses are going in the same direction. I just preferred the HEV from Batthyany Square station. When you get off maybe the first thing is the Peter and Paul's Catholic Church on Lajos Street, and also there is an impressive Synagogue as well. Continue your walk to Kalvin k√∂z, where is the oldest Reformed Church of Budapest. On Main Square, there are two famous sculptures, The Waiters an Imre Varga sculpture and Szindb√°b, a figure from a well known Krudy novel. Walking around this area, you find plenty of interesting museums, for example, the Victor Vasarely Museum, the Varga Imre Collection, the (Roman) Baths Museum and many more. Also, there is the Florian Square with Roman ruins, and many cozy little restaurants, where you can enjoy not only the meals but also the pleasant surroundings. My favorite is the Z√∂ldkapu restaurant, and another is the √öj Sipos Hal√°szkert. There're so many things to see and enjoy, that one day isn't enough. You have to go back again, and again.
31;Great museum with a range of displays;Came here for a Bosch exhibition, and was not disappointed. In addition to the Bosch displays, there was a wonderful range of art work from a range of timeframes to enjoy. A must visit when in Budapest.
31;Great collection;If you are into paintings this is the place to be! Such a beatiful collection. We spend about 2.5 hours in the museum but could not see it all. The collection is nicely organized by style/country and period. Dont miss out on the great pieces by Cranach and Rafael.
31;Beautiful;Beautiful Egyptian and Greek collection underground in a beautiful building. The museum is beautifully arranged. There is a free cloakroom. Unfortunately, I didn't have the energy to see the rest of the museum but it seems to me that it would have been worth it. Overall, great experience. Free with the Budapest card.
31;very interesting;the building itself is very impressive. The collection is very interesting and worth a visit. the facilites are also excellent with a very clean and organised cloakroom and toilets. The bar and restaurant are very clearly marked for allergies and quality of food is excellent.
31;For art sake!;The museum is located adjacent to the Heroes Square and is a grand structure in its own right. We didn't have time to enjoy the exhibitions, but the building itself is a work of art.
31;RUDE STAFF;Men at entrance  VERY RUDE.  NO access to  Cafe or washrooms after spending over 100EUROs in the shop. Not helpful or even  polite.
31;My favorite art place in Budapest üá≠üá∫;The Museum of Fine Arts Budapest is Hungary's largest and finest art museum. Its collection includes thousands of artwork from prehistory to the present. Old master paintings (13th to 18th centuries) was my favorite containing over 3000 paintings in the collection. If you enjoy art and paintings, make sure you allocate 3-5 hours to this museum. Felt that the Fine Arts Museum was above the Hungarian National Gallery in terms of display of art, more organized and the visit was more structured. This museum was my number 1 most enjoyed experience in Budapest. Entry price: 11EUR
31;Bosch exhibition;One of our main goals of visiting Budapest was the Bosch exhibition. It was an extra, that we could watch all exhibitions with the Bosch ticket, so we took the chance. It's a great building with lots to see, we seen hours here. Even the building itself worths a visit. There are many artifacts here from different eras of history. If someone likes arts they should certainly spend some time here.
31;Rude staff which do not speak English. Silly security rules.;The staff are all elderly and none speak English! Whether you bought a ticket online for a specific time is irrelevant to them, you have to queue anyway. If you have a bag it needs to be searched. After searching, it still needs to be deposited in the cloakroom. What is the point of that? If you get too close to the paintings, the staff give you a rude telling off in Hungarian, despite there being no signs stating in English how close you can get to the paintings.
31;Nice Visit;It‚Äôs a very good Art Museum - not great. If you like religious themes, you‚Äôll love it as that seems to be the emphasis. We went for the Bosch exhibit which was also very good - not great. We walked here from the city center in about an hour. Kind of confusing to track rooms you‚Äôve visited, but after a while, the art seemed all the same to me. Next to Heroes Plaza added to trip worthiness.
31;A first class art museum;A first class art museum. Great orientation for guests from abroad. Beautiful premises. The Bosch temporary exhibition was fabulous, with precious art and good documentation. The permanent collection has a few highlights that should not be missed. The panel describing these in the entry hall is worth consulting. As an advice - book tickets in advance to avoid the lines.
31;Badly Organised;Bought a ticket line for the Permanent Collection and had to wait 1 hour outside in the sun.<br>What‚Äôs the point of buying a ticket in advance when people who arrive after you without a ticket get in before you.<br>Once inside the art is fabulous, hardly anyone inside‚Ä¶they‚Äôre all queuing outside.<br>You should have 2 lines one for people with Hieronymus Bosch Tickets and one for people who have tickets for the permanent collection.<br>Won‚Äôt return.
32;Beautiful Neo-Gothic architecture;This icon of Budapest and Hungary lives up to all expectations. The outside stone had so much detail and the grand scale of the building was impressive. The inside is incredibly ornate.
32;Costly entrance fee;We purchased the tickets online directly from the official Parliament site. When I tried to prebook the audio guide for English tour , it was always not available however I discovered that if you look around 8am on the day you want to visit it is likely you will be able to get a ticket. <br>The building itself is beautiful however the tour is only 45 minute long and you have to go through security to take the tour. <br>It was quite costly for a 45 minute tour, I most probably wouldn‚Äôt recommend it as it was not value for money. It cost around ¬£25:00 per person.
32;One of the most beautifully ornate buildings anywhere!;This is probably the most recognizable building of Budapest‚Äôs endless catalogue of amazing architecture. I did not go inside but walked around it several times. I did hear a tour guide noting that the building was too big and too expensive but it sure is a fascinating collection of various architectural styles! It is absolutely worth visiting. However, note that the best views of the building are not AT the building but rather across the river or on the Elizabeth Bridge.
32;An imposing building in the centre of Budapest;The building is an imposing landscape that every tourist should visit in Budapest. It‚Äôs luxury is outstanding and you should go there to take many pictures. In the night, it is lighted and it is even more beautiful landscape!!!
32;Tours must be booked online;Touring the Hungarian Parliament Building was at the top of my to-do list during a visit to Budapest in early March 2023. Booked an early morning 8:30 am tour. An audio guide is included in the ticket price. It was fascinating to learn about the history of the building and Budapest. It is truly architecturally stunning.<br><br>Tours must be booked online. Time slots for tours during peak hours fill up fast so it is a good idea to plan ahead. Make time to tour the Hungarian Parliament Building when visiting beautiful Budapest.
32;Great opportunity to visit working seat of government!;Learned a great deal about Hungary's historical and current political structure.  Building is simply amazing.  At 45 minutes, the tour is an appropriate length of time to impart knowledge and generate interest in learning more, all without inundating tourists with details they'd never retain.<br>We couldn't book online (all tours sold out), but showed up on the day of and were able to get a ticket.  Go early if you expect to get a ticket.  We arrived at 9 am and got a ticket for the 3:30 tour time slot.  This was in the middle of shoulder season.  Advise to reserve well in advance for peak season travel.
32;Spectacular;This would have to be one of the most beautiful buildings in the world, especially when seen from th Danube at night. Spectacular. Tried to visit during the day but totally booked out!
32;Gorgeous;This architect was gorgeous, it is a must visit, next to the River, glows like a piece of gold at night, amazing walk during day and night.
32;A definite stop;The tour was well worth it-and it's best to book in advance. we were there at the end of March and by 10am they had posted a sign that all tickets for the day were sold out.<br>And in addition to the tour, there are two additional sites just outside the building. one addresses how things were built, and the other is quiet poignant, as it details the 1956 rebellion.
32;Parliament;One place that you must visit in Budapest is their historic parliamentary building. The tour guide named levy was wickedly funny and entertaining‚Ä¶i enjoyed this tour üëçüëå
32;Must do when visiting Budapest. Book early;We thought we were not going to be able to visit the Parliament as available slots got booked up weeks in advance. Fortunately I discovered that they had released some more slots in the morning of the day we wanted to visit and I booked. The building is obviously the most famous landmark in Budapest and is as interesting inside as out. You even get to visit the Hungarian crown jewels. Visit takes about 45 minutes but that does include getting through security. One other strange thing was that they won't let you in with an eticket on your phone. You are told to exchange it for a paper version. No idea why!
32;Beautiful Building;Very informative tour, although felt we could have benefited from a smaller group as sometimes it was difficult to hear guide if you were at the back.   Guide very knowledgeable.
33;Take the stairs up to the tower!;Visited St. Stephen's Basilica (Szent Istv√°n Bazilika) on a chilly, cloudy day in early March 2023. Really magnificent to see! The office for a tower ticket is across the street from the church next to Starbucks. There is an elevator to the observation tower but taking the stairs up to it is rewarding. Great panoramic views of Budapest.
33;Beautiful Church and Interesting Relic;OK, it is really annoying that the tickets are formulated in a conniving way to push people to pay more. The tickets are either for the cupola view OR the sanctuary - or a combination ticket for both. It would have been less tacky to offer a sanctuary ticket and an up-charge for the treasure and tower. We skipped the tower and treasury because the most fascinating bit is the relic of the hand of St. Stephen which is in the sanctuary on the right side. The church is enormous and serene and has the most amazing art. The whole paying to go into churches is new since the last time I toured Europe but I guess that's what keeps them up. It is worth paying for this one.
33;Well worth the visit;This is a beautiful place or was 20 yr ago so many tourists now you can hardly move but a must visit place.the building and architecture are amazing and definitely a must visit in this gorgeous city
33;Great views inside and out;I don‚Äôt know why I thought this was a free attraction, I read some reviews saying this but no one got in the door without purchasing a ticket first from the office across the street. Worth it though, i audibly gasped several times, beautiful inside. it‚Äôs the most Catholic place I ever went. I went for the cheap ticket then changed my mind when the card reader faltered, glad I did because I wanted to do the balloon fly thing to see out across the city but as others mentioned its always shut - except for the one time I was at the top of St Stephens Basilica of course, then I could see it flying in the distance :D.
33;Spectacular interior;You buy tickets from an office across the street. Either a ticket for the interior or one for the treasury and panorama. <br>Only took the interior ticket. The Interior is spectacular. Well worth the visit
33;Charge to enter a church;The entrance fee for this church was just unaffordable for a family. Jesus would not be amused that his house is being used to make money.
33;Worth a visit;What a lovely building to look around<br>The admission was under ¬£10 and that included a lift (or stairs) up to the viewing platform at the base of the dome. This afforded great views of the city.<br>It is a great building with lots of fascinating paintings and great architecture.
33;Amazing;Fantastic experience and allows you to have some peaceful time in amazing surroundings. It‚Äôs definitely well worth a visit.
33;Beautiful cathedral;Just over ¬£10 for an all inclusive ticket is excellent value. The cathedral itself is beautiful. The views from the panoramic terrace offer a 360 of Budapest and the treasury contains important religious artefacts. <br>The hand is both gruesome and fascinating especially considering it‚Äôs 1000 years old. <br>Some reviews say it‚Äôs dark inside, but it is beautiful and bathed in colour.
33;Great building;I wanted to go into this church to see st Stephen‚Äôs right hand. The history of the church is impressive
33;An amazing building with great views;The building is so impressive and steeped in history, a must-visit when in Budapest.<br><br>The combined ticket is also a must with a great view from the tower.
33;Visit the roof;You have to buy a ticket to get into the basilica. It is not cheap (4000 Huf). The basilica itself is nice but not super special. there is a shrine with the hand of a saint. But you have to get up to the terrace for the view. It is very narrow up there. And probably in high season it will be a long wait. But great views!
34;This place has guided tours on a trail in the nature reserve. It's closed in winter. The panorama to the whole of Budapest is magnificent. There are way too many interesting stories from the name to the insect hotels that they have created. I met a guide called ANNA who is very fluent in English and an amazing guide.;
34;Ok, the view is alright, but for 2 euros per person getting a 10 minutes worth of below average view of the city (you get a waaaay better view  from a ton of other locations for FREE). Don't bother going in there...;
34;Born there. In Muskotaly utca. Lovely place. Really miss it, being an ocean and a continent away. I miss the country of my birth, of my ancestors. My beautiful homeland. Thankful for my memories;
34;Ill tell you what! Best view you can get in 360. Helpfull, professional staffs.;
34;Born, and lived there. Still so beautiful!!!!!!!!;
34;Wonderful view point;
34;The guided tour was very interesting, it was more than an hour long. The view is wonderful, and during the drive we got an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe plants and animals living on Eagle Mountain. Great weekend program!;
34;It can even be reached from the city center with a pleasant walk (e.g. from M√≥ricz). The visitor center is modest but nicely done. The observation deck is fantastic, you can see the whole city, and the signs that show which building is what is very useful.;
34;"We were there on Aug. 20, we were afraid that there would be many people, but... people went to Lake Balaton instead. We also paid for a tour guide, we didn't regret it. The people working there were very nice, we learned a lot of interesting things about this corner of our city. Wonderful panorama, interesting plants and the green lizard... We recommend it to everyone. (20 - 25 minutes from Keliti by public transport)";
35;Something different, something historic, something personal.;To honour the Jewish people during the Second World War.<br> <br>Unfortunately, this monument both represents a negative and positive historic memory.<br><br>Negative, in regards to the atrocities committed, the families who witnessed it, lived it and stories relayed.<br><br>Positive ‚Äì in keeping the memory alive and to continue telling the story to all future generations and hopefully prevent anything remotely similar happening again.<br><br>This nonetheless, it is a great little memorial stretching into the distance along the shores of the river.
35;Poignant and Powerful Memorial!;One of Budapest‚Äôs most tragic tales occurred during World War II when 3,500 people, including 800 Jews, were ordered to remove their shoes and stand by the river, after which they were executed. The poignant and powerful memorial along the Danube River immortalizes the shoes left on the riverbank ‚Äî a stark reminder to never forget the past. It was erected on April 16, 2005. It was conceived by film director, Can Togay, together with sculptor, Gyula Pauer, to honor the victims of the fascist Arrow Cross terror in Budapest during World War II. The sculptor created sixty pairs of period-appropriate shoes out of iron, attached to the stone embankment, accompanied with the cast iron signs, reading in Hungarian, English, and Hebrew the following words: "To the memory of the victims shot into the Danube by Arrow Cross militiamen in 1944‚Äì45. Erected 16 April 2005." They symbolize that no one, regardless of their standing, age or gender, was spared.
35;Creative and poignant way to tell their stories‚Ä¶;The informational panels were very detailed and to see English translations were very welcomed (there aren‚Äôt many in Budapest).<br><br>They covered the devastating history of the Hungarian Jews and both their oppressors and saviours. Made for very interesting read nonetheless. <br><br>Plus was interesting that it was open air and to get to it you have to walk around the stunning Parliament building (like no other I‚Äôve ever seen before) something that should be admired too.<br><br>Only drawback is that the info seemed to have a timeline but no order was specified so created for confusing read. And many people just come to just picture the shoes themselves.
35;Moving tribute to the Jews slaughtered in Hungary;We went on a one hour walking tour of the city, run by the Hop-on Hop-off tour bus, the tour walked through several important highlights of the city including the 'Shoes on the Danube'. They are made of stainless steel or bronze and positioned along the quay side of the river, they are a tribute to the terible holocaust events of Hungary near the end of the second world war. Over 25,000 Jews, Romanies, and so called undesirables were lined up on the dock side, told to remove their shoes as the Nazi's shot them in the back to fall into the Danube so were disposed off as the current took them away down stream. A sad, moving but fitting tribute to a horrific period of history. Recommend a visit and also recommend the walking tour as you learnt some important information to go with what your seeing. Highly recommended.
35;Moving memorial;The shoes on the riverbank represent a poignant and moving tribute to the Jews who were lined up and shot by the anti Semitic arrow cross militiamen . They were ordered to remove their shoes before being shot and thrown into the river. The iron shoes are reminiscent of the styles worn at the time and the ravages that war inflicts on wear and tear. The memorial is thought provoking and a chilling reminder of what Hungarian Jews endured during WW2
35;Extremely sobering;Set right on the edge of the river Danube this memorial is both beautiful and thought-provoking. As we approached it, a silence descended around it even though there were many people there. <br><br>It has that effect on you.<br><br>It almost seemed wrong to take photographs of it due to the harrowing events that it commemorates but we wanted to remember it. <br><br>It is a beautiful idea executed perfectly and I would highly recommend you visit it should you be in Budapest.

36;Simply, breathtaking view of the City.;For a great view of Budapest, the visit to this monument is a must.  You can walk (climb) or drive to this location.  Well maintained and clean.
36;A monument from the communist era.;First erected in 1947, it was to commemorate the Soviet troops that liberated Hungary during the war but was later changed to those who sacrificed their lives for independence.  Its on an iconic spot overlooking the city on Gellert hill.<br>It has commanding views over the city and castle hill and is well worth the effort for the views alone.<br>However, the citadel and monument area was under restoration and wasn't accessible for people as it had temporary fencing surrounding it. We couldn't get around it so we had to go down and catch a tram up to the castle along to road by the river.
36;Communist Statue!;The Liberty Statue on Gellert Hill is one of the few prominent Communist statues which remained in situ after the transition to democracy, in part because of its iconic location overlooking the city. The statue was first erected in 1947 to commemorate the Soviet troops who lost their lives liberating the country, however the engraving was later changed so that it commemorated, ‚Äúall who sacrificed their lives for the independence, freedom, and prosperity of Hungary.‚Äù The panoramic views from underneath the statue are unparalleled and help to make the walk to the top of the hill well worth it.
36;Statue under construction, but local Hungarians keep tourists engaged;It'd be really cool trip to hike almost in the city centre. However, it seems that Budapest doesn't really care about the park around the statue. Paths, benches etc. looks like someone has maintained them during USSR times last time. Also I was unlucky to bump into a fence at the top as there are some construction going on. However, at the top I could sit next to a sleeping homeless man and a gang of middle aged Hungarians with huge bellies that were scamming tourists in the game of three cups. I'd say that it was a truly Hungarian experience ;)
36;Closed for 2022;The area of Citadel and Liberty statue is closed due to reconstruction for 2022. You can still go around.

36;Read the History of the Monument;Sitting atop Gellert Hill, it can be seen from throughout the town and is impressive at night. Read up on the change from the Soviet era to the current version of the statue.
36;Nice views, impressive statue;It's a huge statue of Liberty. The view here are nice. It's visible from across the city. What else can I say? You will most probably come here anyway if you visit Budapest as the Citadel(la) hill is very beautiful and pleasing to walk around with lots of sights.
36;Over looking the city;Located on Gell√©rt Hill, stands this monument, erected in 1947, was originally dedicated to the Soviet Liberation During WWII, nowadays, it represents a memorial of all Hungarians that have fallen for the freedom of Hungary.
36;A nice statue;Besides rewarding views of the city and the surrounding area on top of Gellert Hill, you will come across this Liberty Statue.  It is a nice statue and suits the scenery very well.  It honors those who fought and died for freedom in Hungary's history.
36;Commemorates those who sacrificed their lives for Hungary;Liberty Statue (a.k.a.or Freedom Statue or Szabads√°g-szobor) is a monument at the top of Gell√©rt Hill commemorating those who sacrificed their lives for the independence, freedom, and prosperity of Hungary.  It was erected in 1947 in remembrance of the Soviet liberation of Hungary during World War II, ending the occupation by Nazi Germany.  The 14m bronze statue (by Hungarian Zsigmond Kisfaludi Str√≥bl) stands atop a high pedestal. a woman with upraised arms holds a large palm leaf, symbolizing peace. On either side of the base are male figures on smaller pedestals: a triumphant figure holds a torch (representing progress), and a second depicts a man fighting a mythical creature (representing evil).  In the years after 1947, Hungarians regarded the Soviets less as liberators and more as oppressors.  The statue was partially damaged during the 1956 Hungarian uprising.   After the 1989 transition from communist rule to democracy, the original inscription was modified to read: "To the memory of those all who sacrificed their lives for the independence, freedom, and prosperity of Hungary", and a Russian version was removed.  The statue of a soldier holding a Soviet flag (originally at the base) was banished to Memento Park (a sculpture park with Communist-era statues  on the outskirts of the city).  Liberty statue is a good place to watch sunrise and sunset. it is beautifully lit at night.  Several paved footpaths (stairs and streetlights) ascend the hill, offering panoramic views over the Danube, Elizabeth and Szabadsag bridges, Pest, and the hills beyond.  Sturdy shoes and water are recommended if you ascend on foot.  Liberty Statue is accessible at all times with no entry fee.
36;romantic!;it's the most beautiful view of the Budapest. very romantic place with a stunning view!!! but...it is too high to walk it and yes there is NO lift, you have to walk it. also if you go at night as we did get a torch you'll need it!
37;Chain Bridge;When this bridge opened in 1849 it was the first permanent bridge to cross the Danube River in Hungary. Even though it is the Szechenyi Bridge, it is commonly known as the Chain Bridge. At the time of its construction, it was regarded as one of the modern world's engineering wonders. The decorations along the bridge are made of cast iron.
37;Book at your own risk...;Originally, I booked a stay for 3 nights in Sept 2020. Of course, all trips were cancelled because of COVID. Instead of full refund, the hotel said they could only give me credit for future stay with 12 month. I did not argue and wanted to be helpful in the difficult situation. I took the credit option. When I was ready to use my credit for a stay for Sept 2021 trip, lo and behold, the hotel is closed for renovation upon further notice. After 6 month of emails back and forth with Accor support and some Chain Bridge Hotel personnel. No action has been taken from the hotel about my credit at all. Unbelievable!!! At least they should have the decency to tell me that: I am sorry, we don't have money to refund your booking credit! How could this be a Sofitel and TripAdvisor Hotel of The Year 2021!!! How could I continue to be loyal to Sofitel, particularly as a Diamond member?!
37;Ripped Off;Booked and paid up front at this hotel as part of trip after a river cruise. Everything was cancelled (including flights, so no way to even get there if we wanted to) was cancelled due to Covid. Received refunds from cruise, other hotels, airlines etc, BUT NOT FROM THIS HOTEL. Definitely don't pay up front if you are planning a trip to this hotel, they will just steal your money if you can't make it. So wrong on all levels
37;Perfect location, spooky athmosphere;Close the parliament building, hotel with dated athmosphere, due to C19 situation the hotel was only book around 10% with many ristrictions however the lovely staff did everything to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable. A la card breakfast menu left many options to start the day...Mr Bela at the reception went the extra mile...
37;good place but poor stuff;it's funny how some people work in a place but they don't know how to do theyr job especially at the reception in rest the place it's really nice and the rooms are beautiful i wish to be more place in the rooms because it's a little bit too busy the room but in rest it's all beautiful 
37;worth visiting during strange times;The stay during the covid-19 time was strange , hotel less occupied but the staff took very ood care of us. As fewer guest were at the hotel the staff had more time. I would suggest to visit he city and the hotel now. We will never have a nice summer with that amount of people in the city. If you can you should take a room with executive services. The normal lounge was closed but the alternative offered in the Paris/Budapest restaurant as very, very good. A pity that the GM didn't take time to greet the few guests in the hotel. We had nicer experiences with the previous general manager...
37;Excellent restaurant;The Sofitel in Budapest has an excellent location and when you get a room with view over the chain bridge, it is worth it. The architecture with the tremendous open space is impressive. I have been now twice, service has been very good. Staff is really nice. The only reason why I don‚Äôt give 5 stars is that the rooms need renovation. During my last trip I used the restaurant several times!and I considered it top quality. A had for example a Cesar‚Äòs salad which was excellent and had nothing to do with the typical Cesar‚Äòs salas you get in Hotels as the only health option on the room menu...And again , service was excellent
37;Good stay evan if hotel was quite empty due to covid;hotel was rather empty due to covid so it was not the "old" experiance and in a way looked a bit wierd and empty. We got a junior Suite upgrade on the 5 Floor corned with perfect view of chain Bridge and danube. Mini bar is empyt same as the nespresso so you have to order that. The lounge is not open but you can use the resturant on the ground floor.Room was big, WiFi worked, you get a small kit with a mask, wipe and desinfectant in the room and there are lots of dinfectants by Lifts on each room. The breakfast is to order only was not bad even if it took quite some time but we felt OK and as there were not mny guests we had enough distance from the rest. We had a nice drink in the outside are in the evening but must say the City is rather empty as wlell, actualy never saw Budapest so empty
37;first trip after COVID-19 lockdown;I was one of the first guests in the Hotel after the lockdown. I felt very safe and very welcome. Excellent room, greeat view and perfect services offered from high qualified Hotel staff. Last but not least a geat breakfast!
37;Old World Charm;We travelled for a short 3 night City break just before Christmas 2019, staying at the Sofitel. Firstly, we loved the location close to Chain Bridge and an easy walk over to Buda and the Buda Castle. We were also very impressed with the breakfast, which had a huge variety of hot and cold dishes, fresh juices and smoothies - certainly set us up for the day. The concierge was very helpful and knowledgeable giving advice on places to visit and booking a Danube cruise for us. They also revised branded umbrellas to use when it rained heavily.
38;Central walking street;Something for everyone here as it's a long, walking street, mostly closed to cars, so you're free to wander and look. Interesting facades to be seen, and plenty of shops, eateries, hobby shops, massage parlors, eateries, souvenir shops, etc.. Easy to navigate and plenty to see.
38;Must visit;Though this time I visited Budapedt for a short, didn't want to miss visiting one of my favourite spots in the city, for both walking and shopping
38;Pedestrian shopping street;V√°ci Street in downtown Budapest is a very attractive and modern pedestrian shopping street.<br><br>It has been voted 7th of 16 pedestrian streets in the world based on atmosphere,<br>attractiveness, cleanliness, and customer service in shops.<br><br>You will find many brand names located along withy strip together with cafes , restaurants and bars.<br><br>Our hotel was a short walk from this street.
38;Tourist shopping;This is quite a long street that goes from Vorosmarty Square to the Central Market Hall. It has some lovely shops, restaurants and cafes along it but mainly lots of tourist shops selling the same items but at different prices. If you are looking for something specific, the items get cheaper the further away from Vorosmarty Square you get. Nice for a stroll, especially after dark in December when all the fairy lights are on.
38;Great choice of souvenirs;A tourist street with cafes and souvenir shops. You can find some good value souvenirs here - I bought most of mine in one of the shops there.
38;Nice pedestrian shopping street;The place we stayed is only 5 mins away from this shopping street.  We came to this place almost every day. <br><br>The shopping area covers a few city blocks. There are many brand name stores, small boutiques, souvenir stores, candy stores, cafes, restaurants, fast food chains etc.  You can always find something you need.
38;Tourist Mecca;This is a shopping, dining, entertainment street packed with tourists. There is a beautiful church - St Michaels, and several monuments. It even has a KFC if you need a fried chicken fix.<br><br>If you are looking for beautiful buildings and quiet parks, there are better options. We suggest Andrassy Avenue, which we call Budapest‚Äôs Avenue des Champs-√âlys√©es.
38;Good food;Food was very good and good service!! Especially Rima was very kind and helpful. Watch out the portions are big but very tasty.
38;Not sure why this is classed as a Top Ten thing to do in Budapest.;Not really sure why this is so popular and have no clue why it was ranked as a 'Top 10' thing to do in Budapest in my DK guide book.  There are far better places to visit, and far nicer streets to walk and explore in Budapest than Vaci utca.  We walked down it on a few occasions during the day and at night just on our way to other places and there was nothing that really stood out.  There are some restaurants, some gift shops and at night by 9pm it was dead.  My advice is walk down it as part of your travels but don't allocate special time to do so.
38;Pedestrian shopping street;This street is located just a couple of blocks from the Danube banks.  Lots of people and many restaurants.  Not a place I would frequently go to, but it was a nice walk on a beautiful day in Budapest.
38;Most famous street in Budapest - but not the best one;A lot of people will say,  Vaci utca (Vaci street) is the best one, or whatever in Budapest. My opinion is that there is a lot of better streets in Budapest to walk, or eat, shoping or whatever, such as Andrasy, Kiraly street, Hercegprima, streets around Basilica and Parlament.<br>Also, prices in bistros and restaurants are higher in Vaci than in any other place.<br>For example, famous chimneh cake (kurtosz) is here between 2000-2500ft, and 500m away you can find it for 500ft, or go to Molnars and eat it for 1500 maybe the best one.<br>Lot of toursist in first part of street, and spooky, dark and dirty in other part as you go forward in direction to market.<br>Everybody should visit and walk, but that's it, Budapest has much more to offer
38;Christmas vibes;Beautiful view! I was there in November so there was a lot of christmas lights and christmas trees! Good atmosphere
39;Masterpiece of architecture;Budapest Western Railway Station is a masterpiece of architecture located in the busy area of the city. <br>It is worth seeing it.
39;Guest relations;I was bullied by staffs here who resorted to intimidation tactics. I gather it is a frequent happening here where the staffs needs lessons on guest relations.
39;yelling and mistreatment by box office staff;I did not like the mistreatment of this woman, I went to buy a ticket to Prague and because I made a mistake in one word she yelled at me excessively and treated me very badly, I left that place crying, I do not know if it is racism or she did not sleep well the night before , but you don't deserve that job if you're going to treat people like that who aren't to blame for your problems, it was an unfortunate situation for me.<br><br>Life is already too difficult for people to treat you badly.  please let's change that üôèüôèüôèüôèüôè
39;Poor ticket offfice service;This railway station used to be as busy as Picadilly circus. Bustling with life and people. This was the pre pandemic era. There used to be tourists, and shop keepers everywhere inside and outside the railway station building. <br><br> On 24th January 2022 it is sadly a ghost town. Empty station with hardly any people let alone tourists.<br>If anyone is transitting through this station they will have a job to find a cashier desk to buy a ticket and God help you if you need directions.<br>Noting there are ongoing refurbishment works, the ticket office with a cashier is outplaced behind the main building in a temporary container type room. <br>The lady at this only cashier desk was utterly useless when I enquired about the best connection to the Budapest airport. Her advice was to look it up online.  Helpful as a chocolate teapot! <br>This is very contrary to my previous visits to Hungary as it was a very welcoming city! <br><br>I had to ask a cleaner for directions to the  bus station and he kindly advised that there was a direct train connection from the station to the airport. Which I was not aware of. He saved me lots of hassle. Thank you to this kind and human person. <br><br>Thefore you are better off searching everything online and buy your ticket from the ticket  machines. The temp ticket office is a waste of your breath. <br><br>Otherwise Budapest would be a beautiful city once we all become human again!!
39;Training it from Budapest to Bratislava;We travelled from Budapest to Bratislava by train. <br>Budapest-Nyugati - station to Bratislava hl. station. The Budapest Nyugati (western) railway station is often referred to as Nyugati, is one of the three main railway terminals in Budapest. <br>The station is a bit grimey, but the train was fine. We travelled to the station by tram (4 or 6) <br>We purchased the ticket online,<br>and then went to the station and collected the ticket from the machine after entering the confirmation number . We had designated seats. we travelled second class. It took 2.5 hours <br>From<br>BUDAPEST-NYUGATI<br>To<br>BRATISLAVA<br>Cost 30 euro for 2 adults ( over 60)<br><br>Train travel is enjoyable, relaxing.
39;Aka Nyugati P√°lyaudvar;We happened to be walking past so stuck our heads in to look at the railway station. It felt very Eastern European and the locos reminded me of the Top Trumps I played with my brother as a kid.
39;A classic station.;This is a lovely classic station (if only too hectic).<br>The surrounding isn't that beautiful.<br>There's a lovely shopping mall just next to the station.
39;Another beautiful European station!;Light-filled and quite beautiful.  Our train to Vienna left right on the minute! Love their efficiency!  Highly recommended,
39;Beautiful old train station;The architecture is absolutely beautiful, built in bricks and ironworks.  It has a simple 'U' shaped plan with wings on either side.  The wing on the left has a gorgeous interior shared by McDonald's and another cafe on the upper level.
39;Bit outdated;3.5 stars. The station is a bit outdated, but it serves it purpose. There are restaurants and coffee shops inside the building. I believed the ticket booth is 1 level down. I went on a railjet train so I booked my ticket in advanced online. If you do take the train, watch for your valuables!
39;Efficient;This building designed by Eiffel is beautiful. There are only a few places to buy food to bring on the train. I highly recommend this as the food on the trains leaves little to be desired. Also pay close attention to track numbers they are small and difficult to see. Not the most highly run train stations I been in but ok.
39;Trains are modernized, restroom on board;Easy trip from Budapest Nyugati to Veresegyhaz. Nice to have a restroom on board and price is very reasonable.
