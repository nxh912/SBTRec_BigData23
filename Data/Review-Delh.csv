1;Best Place to Buy Shalwar Qameez;Amazing place for shopping. Especially if you are going to buy cultural dresses, there is no better place than this. Choose a day where there is less traffic otherwise you would have to spend many hours on the road.
1;Bazaar shopping;This was my 3rd stop of my 1/2 day Lahore tour . Delhi Gate was the entrance to shahi haman , bazaar , walking distance to Masjid Wazir Khan . Can see the daily life of the locals , can bargain here for clothes , scarves, khussa shoes etc .
1;Very interesting place;This was the first time I had travelled to Walled city Lahore with my friends. The expert WCLA guide Fatima who accompanied us was outstanding - passionate, informative, engaging and entertaining. The itinerary was very well thought out, I would highly recommend this company to anyone wanting a fun, relaxed, educational holiday - they will deliver!<br>We travelled from Lahore fort to Delhi gate by Rangeela Rikshaw. A local ride known as Rickshaw is prepared in traditional truck art design and is popular among the masses as Rangeela Rickshaw. The tourist avails this ride for touring inside the walled city of Lahore. The Rangeela Rickshaw is used as a tourist ride on designated routes inside the walled city Lahore only.<br>
1;Tick the box;This is one of the twelve gates into the walled old city. Though you cannot find all twelve now. This one is massive and seems to have been reconstructed at some point. Originally built by the mughal emperor Akbar.
1;Historical  Lahore.;Gate is beautiful but there were no signs leading upto it ,no designated parking areas for visitors and no guides available and a very lame excuse was  given for it .Shahi Hamam and Masjid Wazir khan are within walking distance to it.
1;A Gate to History;I would strongly recommend travelers to visit this ancient gate,which tells its own story.Mostly the buildings are of Mughul period,fascinating building structure,woodwork.
1;Organized Cultural Tours for Our Guest;We have organized many cultural and heritage tours for our guest . People just know about the dehli gate but there are a lot of heritage that are still hidden . This was the famous place of Prince DaraShakoo who was the Son of ShahJahan he made path with the red stone to pay tribute to His spiritual teacher Hazart Mian Meer in this place . The places is well restored by Agha khan Foundation and walled city  and that was only the gate that King Akber mostly used it to enter the Lahore City <br>Highly recommended to see this place
1;main entrance to the old city;The market and hustle and bustle are worth a look. Steps away are the Sahi Hammam and the beautiful Wazir Khan masjid.
1;Could be much better...;This is one of the 12 gates of old Lahore city and the one that straight leads to Wazir Khan Mosque. Vehicles are not allowed inside beyond the gate. The area around the gate is very crowded but if one wants to get the taste of old Lahore, this (along with Wazir Khan Mosque that is few hundred yards inside the gate) is the place to go. Lot of small houses with old wooden balconies and small shops selling traditional goods that one may not find in modern Lahore. <br>Parking could be a problem and one may have to find a place that could be 300 to 750 yards away. The gate doesn't perhaps merit an independent visit but along with Wazir Khan Mosque, it forms a good package.
1;Excellent;I have my dad's shop there...when we enter that huge gate..the market starts and we get to see old buildings and many sikh traders over there..
2;Beautiful complex but no easy access. See it from the outside;It is a distinctive and magnificent building complex. A true classic in its style and architecture. Best to see it externally. Between the intense traffic and the place being heavily guarded the direct access is practically impossible. Admire but from the outside
2;Better view on TV screen!;The entire area is cordoned off and so we were not allowed to go anywhere near the building. The view from a distance didnt do justice to its grandeur. The visit was so poor that the BSF posted there even shoo off cars dropping the visitors. Things should be managed better and tourists shouldnt be shooed off like stray cattle!
2;Nice evening visit;The best way to reach here is to get down at Central secretariat metro station and walk down. The view at night is beautiful after the buildings are lit.
2;Circular in shape;Edwin lutyens had designed this building in 1912, and construction was completed in 1927. It is believed that lutyens inspired by the design of the Chausath Yogini temple in morena dist. in Madhya Pradesh and incorporate the circular design.<br><br>Very impressive building but only outside glimpse is possible as entry is restricted.
2;Evening visit;We are arrived at about 6 in the evening and it was a quiet time to view the magnificence and scale of these buildings. We noticed a sign that a light show was to start at 6.30 pm and this covered the buildings in various hues of colour making it all the more striking. it is certainly one of the main sights to see, the grandeur of the architecture from colonial times and so at odds with the drama of other parts of the city.
2;Enjoyed the architecture;While in the area for India Gate, our driver drove us by so we could see the beautiful building. The flowers and areas near by make it a lovely spot.
2;Parliament House Museum;Parliament House Museum is a nice place for our history and constitution. You can see here debate in Lok sabha and Rajya sabha. For entry passes are necessary.
2;The Sansad Bhavan;This is an impressive building, equally as impressive as the Rashtrapati Bhavan the former housing the Parliament and the latter, the President of India. It was constructed between 1921/1927. As with many other buildings and attractions, we had to be satisfied with a drive past on 7/10/19, barricading and armed security everywhere. Apparently it is possible to obtain a general entry pass if the House is not in session. Grandiose.
2;Nice;Indian parliament is one of the best place in India to know our history and lovely place it was .located in sansad Marg New Delhi
2;India’s Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha both Houses of Parliament;This is an architectural beauty and a circular building. British had made it in 1920s. Both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, members transact business here for discussions and former making laws for the Indian democratic Republic. You must spend lot of time to understand the working of this place. <br>Amolak Rattan Kohli <br>Former Governor of Mizoram
2;A seat of Power of the biggest democracy of the world;The impressive round building is a treat to eyes. Done up in Victorian style speaks a volume about the seat of Power of the biggest democracy.
2;Worth a look;Probably not a stand alone attraction, as we could only do a drive past, however it was a very impressive Building (built by the british in the early 1920’s) to see, as it is the centre of the worlds largest democracy.
3;Lovely;Huge and beautiful, Rashtrapati Bhawan strikes you with its grandeur as it comes into view from afar. The walk from there to India Gate is just astounding for the superb views all around.
3;Fabulous once in a lifetime experience;Took the tours of circuits 1, 2, 3 on same day. Its definitely an experience to visit these places once in a lifetime. The Circuit 1 is for the main building which is most difficult to get a booking as it opens 1-2 weeks before and has limited seats. Need to constantly monitor their website in order to book it. <br>Took the metro to central secretariat and then rickshaw (30 pp) to gate 35. Its convenient to first visit the Circuit 3 (gardens) in the morning between 10-12 as it could become difficult to walk around this hugh gardens in hot sun later. On way out their is a cafeteria where you can take snacks and lunch. Later plan to visit the museum (Circuit 2) through gate 30 which houses nice artifacts from history and has a nice guided tour. Finally took another rickshaw to gate 38 for the main building tour at 3 pm which lasts for an hour and covers all main halls inside the rashtrapati bhavan. Overall a once in a lifetime experience which tooks around 6 hrs and lots and lots of walking!
3;SIMPLY STUNNING IS SIZE;This is the home of the Governor of India , and official residence of the Governor. <br>It was constructed between 1799 and 1803 at a cost of R14M (about $A250000) one can only speculate what todays value would be!<br><br>This is an enormous building containing over 340 rooms and is situated on a 130 hectare garden. It is the second largest official residence in the world behind one in Italy<br><br>Its scale needs to be seen to be believed.<br><br>We only had the opportunity of viewing this building from the outside perimeter so could not fully vappreciate it for what it clearly is.<br><br>As we viewed iot from the outside only is reflected in the low score
3;Massive;The Indian Colonial rulers were always thinking big (it wasn't their own money they were spending) : first considered by Lord Wellesley, this behemoth was designed by architect Lutyens. It is now the 2nd largest residence of any head of state in the world, spreading out over 130 hectare.<br>Located opposite India Gate, it makes for a grand photo opportunity.
3;Official residence of the President of India;The complex is one of famous designs by Lutyens . There is a lot of history connected with Rashtrapati Bhavan. The tickets can be prebooked on line. Don’t miss the change of guard ceremony and Mughal Gardens
3;Must visit for every Indian;To view the rashtrapati bhawan was dream come true. The view and knowledge of the Indian history was superb and yes so well maintained. Proud to have visited.
3;Parliament House Museum;Parliament House Museum is a nice place for our history and constitution. You can see here debate in Lok sabha and Rajya sabha. For entry passes are necessary.
3;The Sansad Bhavan;This is an impressive building, equally as impressive as the Rashtrapati Bhavan the former housing the Parliament and the latter, the President of India. It was constructed between 1921/1927. As with many other buildings and attractions, we had to be satisfied with a drive past on 7/10/19, barricading and armed security everywhere. Apparently it is possible to obtain a general entry pass if the House is not in session. Grandiose.
3;Nice;Indian parliament is one of the best place in India to know our history and lovely place it was .located in sansad Marg New Delhi

4;BEWARE: „Tourist information office“ scam at Connaught place!!!;At Connaught place (CP) in New Delhi, next to the „blue moon spa“ there is a small tourist information office. Be careful, they tried to scam me there!!!<br><br>My taxi driver was supposed to bring me to my hotel nearby CP, but stopped at the tourist info to ask for the exact location. The owner of the tourist office told me with many apologies that I cannot reach the hotel now since the roads were closed due to a Covid outbreak. He offered to call the hotel for me and ask how to get there (my phone didnt work with foreign sim card, i had just arrived in India). The tourist office guy was very friendly and put me even on the phone with somebody that pretended to be from the hotel and confirmed that the roads were closed, i should find a new hotel and they would refund me. Then the tourist office manager searched a hotel in another area and wanted to book for me, together with a driver to get there, all for a high but still acceptable price. I should pay directly to him since allegedly they are cooperating with the hotel. And that point I luckily good too suspicious and walked out to find a random tuk tuk which simply brought me to the original hotel, it was basically around the corner! All this story was an elaborate scam, involving the taxi driver, the tourist office guy, another person who acted as hotel staff, and probably the managers from the new hotel!<br><br>Lesson learned: Be extra careful arriving in India and always get a simcard right away to be able to check things yourself!
4;Worst experience;One of the worst place in Delhi. Shops get closed so early like it's a village in such a big city. People kept on staring at my girl l!! Real vultures on loose!
4;Just doesn’t feel safe;I have to agree with all the other tourists on here, the place looks nice in the photos but Connaught Place has been the place where we were constantly harassed, non stop , we have been travelling in India for the past three weeks and nowhere has been as bad as here, no one seemed to take no for an answer and just kept on following us , we left and won’t be going back
4;Nice Place;Visited here a few days back and found out the best market. Costly to Pocket Friendly option available. <br><br>There is a Market Called Palika Bazar where you will get Sasta and Tikau material in terms of Garments and all.
4;Do not waste your time;It looks nice in the photos, but its pretty ordinary, not worth one dollar tuk tuk ride to dry here. In the main old English White buildings, it is western stores at more than normal western (Australia) prices. The only other market around that is operating is called Indian Loom, which is one of those dodgy ridiculous marked up places where the tourist guide takes you so that they can get a commission on whatever you buy. So I’d avoid Connaught Place and Indian Loom, and spend your time somewhere else, I definitely recommend the Sarojini Nagar market, You can spend about three hours or so here and this is where you can pick up T-shirts and jeans for two and three dollars, iPhone AirPods for $10, Saris, belts, all the normal stuff you expecting cheap Asian countries.
4;Mr Shoes;I had a full split in both the rubber soles of my sandals as I walked through Connaught Place.  Initially I told the shoe repairer that approached me that I wasn't interested (the place is tout hell - you need to shut out everyting) but when he showed he'd spotted my broken soles and assured me he could fix them I asked his price.  220 rupees.  I said OK so we swapped sandals and he got to it.  He was great.  He glued the split and then used a real heavy duty black twine to sew the rubber soles together.  It looked like really good workmanship so I paid him 500 rupees.  <br><br>I think he said his name was Mr Shoes which in itself is brilliant.  He's a young guy, from Rahasthan,  pushy but respectful.  If you're in Connaught Place and need shoe work Mr Shoes is your man.  See pic. <br><br>But be careful - there's also some real scam shoe cleaners at Connaugt Place.  The day after Mr Shoes I got done by the 'poo on the shoe' scam.  (one shoe cleaner points out you've got 'poo' on your shoe and another bloke suddenly appears and suggests you get them cleaned).  I knew I'd been done but because of the language barrier I couldn't tell them them off.  I insisted on agreeing on a price of 100 rupees, he half agreed and I watched him closely to make sure he did a good job.  When he was done he said it was 250 rupees.  His mate suddenly re-appeared and said Indian prices sir.  I told both of them  flat out we agreed on 100 rupees and that's all he's getting.  I then gave him the cash and walked off.
4;Continuously followed;Stayed here for a week for work to go to a trade show nearby, not my first time in India. I could not leave the hotel to go for a walk at all. Shops and restaurants all over but every time I walked out of the hotel I couldn’t even go half a block without getting followed by someone trying to convince me to go to a government shopping center where I would pay no tax or try to get a free map. People would start off friendly but ultimately try to get you into a rickshaw. I walked the full inner circle and was hassled constantly by at least 5 separate people, as soon as you shake one the next comes over. <br><br>It was a real bummer I couldn’t do any shopping or try any of the restaurants in the area, had to go elsewhere for that or just get room service if I was lazy.
4;Some nice places, but constant harassment;Some nice restaurants and shops, but was continually harassed by persistent vendors from a local market trying to get me to go there.
4;Great shops but dangerous;Location wise -- tons of great restaurants and shops for you to browse and shop. The only reason why this is 2 star is because you do not want to come here alone.<br><br>Even as a male, you will get approached by multiple individuals trying to scam you, even trying to force you into a rickshaw at some point.<br><br>Unfortunately, I did not feel safe even once when I was at Connaught Place. I rushed what I needed to get and got out of there.
4;Busy and pricey;Not what it was years ago and very busy with more tha the usual traffic .   Can't say I would go back as far more interesting shopping and dinner spots exist nearby.
4;Be CAREFUL WITH SOMEONE ASKING WHERE ARE YOU FROM? I Dont NEED NOTHING ONLY TALK, STUDY ENGLISH or SOMETHING LIKE THAT;Cuidado com sua visita, cuidado com sua visita ao ser abordado por estranhos perguntando de onde você vem? Qual seu pais, não de confiança, são pessoas tentando te levar para algum lugar para que você compre algo não acredite que é para estudar inglês que não querem nada, que são estudantes, são comissionados, não há policiamento no local, TAKE CARE ABOUT PEOPLE THAT START ASK FOR YOU WHERE ARE YOU FROM, THEY TRY TO  to take you somewhere, I think to shop or be commissioned, but it could be some scam too, there is no police on site so avoid answering question or asking for help only say I dont need buy anything!!! Be rude !!!
4;Can't blame the location, but don't do it alone;We decided to explore and do it with just a transfer to the area. Expect to be accosted by attempted scammers - be careful, as they hand you off from one to the other.. check how they use their phones. Couldn't find any place to really shop where we felt safe. Wouldn't do without a guide.
5;Relaxing spot;This is a great place to have a relaxing walk. There are birds, squirrels and butterflies to enjoy. Well worth a visit.
5;Lovely park for a picnic or walk;We stopped at this park to see some local flowers and were surprised by the nice walking paths. There were also old structures to see which was very interesting. The park was large and weather just perfect for a quiet respite from the city.
5;Absolutely recommend;Visited the Lodhi Gardens alone on a beautiful, sunny Saturday afternoon. Not only are the gardens beautiful with historic monuments scattered throughout but they have an incredible atmosphere. Lots of groups of people enjoying the open spaces, relaxing, dancing and enjoying themselves. Take a book, find a shady spot and enjoy this beautiful oasis.
5;Recommended trip;Great place to visit. We did the park tour on our last day and it was quite relaxing. Best of all it’s free. Highly recommended
5;Gardens Tombs;When you need a break from New Delhi's crowds and traffic, spend a couple of hours exploring the garden tombs of Lodhi Gardens.  So peaceful with nice photo opportunities.
5;Beautiful Garden Oasis;A beautiful green garden oasis rich in history and beauty. Beautiful maintained and very clean.  A lovely and relaxing place to explore some amazing old tombs or relax with friends or a good book. A really nice place to take some time out of the amazing chaos which is Delhi. Would definitely recommend a visit here.
5;Lovely place;A huge park and garden in heart of delhi the vibe is just awesome if you go there at evening you might see some birds also.<br>Dedinatly worth to go ! Do visit if you are near by !
5;Lodhi;It is a nice place to explore greenery. I rated it 4 because of youth can be seen annoying but anyways you will enjoy the view even in the hot days.
5;BEAUTIFUL  GARDEN;Very  Nice  garden, full of flowers and ਲੋਟਸ of different species  of trees  and birds  its really awesome  to visit  there I recommend this garden  to  all
5;Love lodhi garden;Delhi's best park. I have had so many memories here and i love to go here for picnics with my friends. It is known for its historical monuments and lovely green sidewalks.
6;Not on the usual list of tourist sites;Had no idea this place existed but with a day to spare our hotel staff recommended a visit.<br>Easy to reach by taxi (and noticed metro not too far away) on the outskirts of New Dehli city<br>Interesting to wander around and look at architecture and enjoy the space. Went early in the day and avoided the crowds.<br>Looked to be well maintained with a number of grounds staff working around the site and maintaining the gardens and lawn
6;spending time with family;very best place for spending quality time with family and there is a lake also for baoting. a museum also for historic knowldge.
6;Please visit in mrng or evng..avoid 12 pm sun no shades;Not required to visit..its khandar now..no more quilla..only coupels come and sit in all places..quite embarrassing to take small kids..as couples dont have rooms..useless place..thank god there was no ticket..otherwise i would go crazy..not worth even a 1 rs
6;Nice place;another nice historical place here in New Delhi. old walls, including 3 gates (unfortunately without access), excellent mosque (Qila-e-kuhna masjid), interesting water well (20m deep with staircase!), and small museum in one area. nice, like it.<br>and again as foreigner one will pay 300r...
6;Nice place to visit along with zoo;Good place as one can spent some time after finishing zoo visit.<br>It has a small musium as well nothing special in musium but place overall god.
6;PURANA QILA, NEW DELHI;• It was a wonderful experience there.<br>• There were many things to see such as baoli, bada darwaza, and old monuments. <br>• Great place for photo shoot. <br>• There is a place under ground where it's path goes to trench but don't worry it is closed now. You can't go there. <br>
6;Ishq e dilli-the light and sound show of Purana Qila;We have heard a lot about light and sound show of Old Fort Delhi so we specially went to see evening light and sound show- Ishq e dilli in Hindi narration. The show covers the history of Delhi through its 10 cities, starting from the 11th-century reign of Prithvi Raj Chauhan to the present days. It also traces Delhi's connection with the mythology of Mahabharata and Indraprastha. The show was not up to the mark as far as projected images on the fort walls are concerned but we definitely enjoyed hearing the History of Delhi.
6;Lover's park;Totally new to Delhi went to Old fort (Purana Qila) and disappointed with the people around us. <br>It is just a place for lovers to make love and we felt uncomfortable to move around in the park being a tourist couple. <br><br>I would not recommend this to tourists and prefer Humayun tomb or Red fort instead. <br><br>Just don't waste time.
6;Light and sound show review;Only went there to see the 7:30 pm light and sound show- Ishq e dilli.<br>While the concept is very good however the quality of the show was fairly average. The projected images on the fort wall was not very clear. <br>The audio and narration was very good and We enjoyed listening to the history of Delhi..<br><br>
6;Definitely worth visiting when in Delhi;Purana Qila is a fort complex thats thought to have been in use in various guises since the 5th century BC and possibly even mentioned in the Indian epic, Mahabharata. The most interesting buildings in the complex are the Qila-i-Kuhna Mosque, Sher Mandal and the museum. <br><br>Definitely worth visiting when in Delhi, give yourself a couple of hours to see everything.
6;Huge fort;The place is very huge and it has its own history and best part will be the night view.It will be decorated with lights and music
6;Back to the 15th century Delhi;Good historic place to visit is you take interest in history and archaeology. It is very near to Nizamuddin Railway station and just adjacent to Delhi Zoo. Nice fort with ruined walls and lovely surroundings. You can connect with history of 15th century India (Especially of Shershah Suri and Humayun) while visiting this place. There is a Mosque also inside the fort. And the famous structure (built by Shershah and used by Humayun as library) where Humayun fell down from stairs and died 3 days later. It is well maintained fort and there is a museum also that brings out the history of Delhi. The ticket price is for the the fort as well as the museum is very nominal. Light and sound shows are also organised every evening at around 6:30 or 7:00 PM. Don't be surprised if you find young couples displaying public affection as this place provides many secluded areas where one can be more adventurous.
7;Red Fort nice experience;It was great! Really a nawesome experience. One must definitely visit this place. The front half of the fort is of red stone and other half is  of marble. Feels glorious for the first timer. Also it has a couple of museums depicting the freedom struggle. And there is a shopping street where you can get most of the decorative and ornaments too...
7;Great visit.;We walked all along the Red Fort at New Delhi. We took lots of photographs. There was such a lot to see in New Delhi. We had a great day the weather was superb and the history of the Red Fort was amazing.
7;Historical monument;It a beautiful monument with historical relevance। The muesum run by Dalmia group is truly excellent, it is a must visit for all
7;A ghost of Mughal history;After building the Taj Mahal in Agra, Mughal Emperor Shahjahan decided to move the imperial capital to Delhi. Here, beginning in the 1640s, he built the Red Fort and the Jama Masjid, the Red Fort to act as a shining example of Mughal architecture at its peak. The fort enclosed many palaces and gardens, housed several thousand people (including many slaves and minions, besides hundreds of members of the royal family), and was the epicentre of life in the city. After 1857, the British occupied the fort, and wreaked havoc. Today, only about 15% of the original Mughal buildings remain. the rest is all mostly British construction.<br><br>But what is there is worth seeing, from the Naubat Khaana/Naqqar Khaana, Halls of Public and Private Audience (Diwan-e-Aam and Diwan-e-Khaas respectively) to the palaces—Rang Mahal, Mumtaz Mahal, Khaas Mahal—to the four museums that are part of the fort. There are several eateries inside (all very basic), toilets (not very clean) and plenty of pleasant pathways through manicured gardens. <br><br>The entrance to the fort is through the Lahore Gate (facing Chandni Chowk), but through some odd and illogical twist, you aren’t allowed to get to Lahore Gate from this point. Instead, you have to go to the Delhi Gate of the Fort (about a kilometre to the side, near the Sunehri Masjid): fortunately, e-ricks are available, which charge you about Rs 10 per person for the ride. At the Delhi Gate of the Fort is the ticket counter. buy your tickets (children below 15 years go free) and then walk, along the outer wall of the fort next to the moat, to the Lahore Gate. After your visit to the Fort is over, you can exit the complex from near the Lahori Gate itself. you don’t need to walk all the way back to Delhi Gate/Sunheri Masjid.<br><br>Note: If you’re coming on the Delhi Metro, getting off at the Jama Masjid metro station is advisable: it’s closer to the Delhi Gate of the Fort.
7;SHEER SIZE AND ARCHITECTURE IS STUNNING;One of the sites of a stay in Delhi.<br><br>This massive fort, commissioned in the mid 1600’s ,is a feature of Delhi and was the palace of the Mogul Emperors .<br><br>Typical of Indian palaces/forts it comprises dining and eating areas of the emperors, huge external walls, large internal spaces once used for gardens etc.<br><br>Can be crowded at times, but the sheer size of the fort still provides for an easy stroll through the palace<br><br>Although striking from a distance, for some treason our tour of two was simply a Photo Stop and not an nactual visit. In this we were very disappointed
7;Largest monument in Delhi;This was the new Mughal headquarters that Emperor Shah Jahan built in 1638, when he abandoned Agra. A massive red-sandstone structure, it was surrounded by a deep moat, fed by the Yamuna River. After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Persian Nadir Shah ransacked the fort, running off with all treasures, including the invaluable Peacock Throne.<br>Both the Delhi and the Lahori Gate are impressive and worth a separate visit.
7;Trip to redfort;Actually name is red fort and it's really wonerfull red one palace we had great time..thanks to tripadvisor
7;Average;This fort is over rated with a cost of 950 rupees to get in. The best part was the museum that hi-lighted portions of Indian history and was interesting to understand. The rest of the grounds hosed a few more buildings but nothing like some of the other forts in India.<br>Being one of the main attractions in Deli I am sure most Tourists will visit it but not as good as rated.
7;Very interesting place, you can easily spend half a day here;This is a place interesting to visitors focusing on Islamic era Indian history. There is a lot here to see - almost overwhelming unless you have a guide or read before coming. 17th century Mughal seat of power. Accessible via two gates. Entrance fee.
7;A sprawling fort complex with shops, museums, and palaces from the time of the Mughals.;The Red Fort of Delhi is a very large fort in Old Delhi. It can be entered from the Lahore Gate and there are shops on the entranceway in. The palaces are preserved, but have clearly been looted over the centuries. For those with an interest in history, the museum of the First War of Independence is worth checking also. Definitely worth a visit if in Delhi.
7;Original Fort was in white color;Red fort which is also famous as Lal Quila is spread across 255 acres in Old Delhi city and become one of the land mark location of the city. Nearest Metro station to Red fort is Chandni chowk station. There are two gates to enter inside one is called as Delhi gate and another one is called as Lahori gate. Delhi Gate is located on the southern wall of the Red fort and Lahori Gate is located on the Western wall.<br> Red fort is recognized as a UNESCO world heritage Site in the year 2007. Red fort was the residence of Mughal emperors for 200 years and after that it was taken over by the Britishers. Bahadur Shah Zafar was the last Mughal Emperor who was coronated here in the year 1837. <br><br>Architecture:<br>Shah Jahan decided to shift capital of Mughal Empire from Agra to Delhi by the side of River Yamuna. Architect Ustad Ahmad Lahauri was then assigned the task of building the Red fort. Architecture is made in Mughal and Indo-Islamic style. Red fort construction was started on 12th May 1638 and completed on 16th April 1648. It was Emperor Shah Jahan who built Red Fort. Red fort was actually white in color  That time it was known as the Quila-E-Mubarak which meant the blessed fort. when it was built by Shah Jahan, Originally made with Lime stone and eventually started chipping off. The British Government then had the entire monument painted red, this changing its original color forever and also name changed as Red Fort.<br>A satellite view of this fort reveals an octagonal shape.<br><br>Tourist Attractions in side fort:<br>Though there are many structures in the fort were either destroyed or badly damaged, the red fort still houses many historic places. They are<br>1. Mumtaz Mahal:<br>2. Khas Mahal<br>3. Rang Mahal<br>4. HIra Mahal<br>5. Moti Masjid<br>6. Hammam<br>7. Diwan e Aam<br>8. Naubat Khana<br>9. Diwan e Khas<br>10. Hayat Bajsh Bagh<br>11.

7;Old Delhi area visit;Good place to visit in winter time. Very near to Chandi chowk where you can do lots of shopping.really nice place
8;Salimgarh Fort;This fort has quite it's fare share of history related to INA and Netaji and is a must visit place for history buffs. Though it doesn't get as much footfall as Red Fort.
8;Club with the Red Fort, don't spend more than 20 minutes here;The Salimgarh Fort in Delhi predates its much more famous neighbour, the Red Fort and can only be accessed through a path leading from the latter. These forts, once separated by a branch of the River Yamuna, have this job being done by the Ring Road in present times.<br><br>The Salimgarh Fort has a small area housing the Swantantra Senani Smarak, which is a small museum highlighting the history of the Indian National Army (INA) of Netaji Subash Chandra Bose and its exploits. Some of the INA's commanders were imprisoned in this fort and trialed by the British after the Second World War, but were released, following a public outcry.<br><br>Once can also see a jail where these freedom fighters were kept as well as an abandoned mosque. The main railway line to Old Delhi Railway station cuts right through this fort and a pedestrian overbridge over this line must be climbed to get to the museum.
8;History Lover !! Don't Miss this  place;Salimgarh Fort is something that you will definitely miss if you don't pay attention to road signage. When you cross the Chhatta Chowk bazaar inside the Red Fort complex and turn towards the museum, the road leads to Salimgarh fort renamed as Swatantrata Senani Smarak.<br>Salimgarh Fort has its own share of gory tales but due to the absence of any structures barring a few barracks and a ruined mosque, everything else has disappeared with time. Built by the successor of the mighty Sher Shah Suri, Salim Shah, after whom the fort is named, Salimgarh served as an imperial dungeon for the Mughals. Perhaps, Aurangzeb and the Britishers put the fort in the best of use where hard-core prisoners are put into trials and death.<br><br>Don't miss seeing the Indian National Army(INA) soldier's memorial exhibition. Also, there is a jail which is in pretty much bad shape due to the absence of any preservation work. One of the few rooms inside the jail served as the last surviving solitary confinements that supposedly housed the three Indian National Army(INA) soldiers namely Col. Prem Sahgal, Col. G.S Dhillon and Major Gen. S.N Khan before the famous Red Fort Trials in '46.<br><br>Visit this place before you enter Red Fort. It will be in chronological order.
8;Salimgarh Fort;A place that you can enjoy your free time with your friends and that its a historical fort that will excite you.
8;Nice;A nice place to visit. Often very less crowded, this place reveals some of the facts of Indian history.
8;Lost in time;Not many tourists reach the Salimgarh Fort after several hours in the Red Fort. Most likely nobody else but you will be there. If you are interested strictly in history or architecture, you won’t be very excited.  But if you are a time travel enthusiast, this place is for you. Time stopped there about 150 years ago. Nothing was restored or improved from then on.  You will see the same Yamuna River (no matter how terribly it is polluted now), same walls, same ruins lit by merciless Indian sun.  Turn on your imagination and enjoy!

9;spectacular street show, from a rickshaw;try a rickshaw, from Jama Masjid to the spices shops, passing on the main road to Fatehpuri Masjid, and if you are lucky to find a celebration of Ganesha, for instance, the show of the street will be spectacular<br>mad traffic, I really don't know how come we did not touch somebody in that colorful crowded alleys they call streets<br>that kind of experience could give you an idea about real life in a great Indian city<br>do not avoid it, try to interact as much as possible
9;Crazy Morning Enjoying the Sights of the Delhi Spice Market;We think this the essence of India, well away from the regular tourist traps. We know this because this is a very busy area with all the locals going about their business. Our tour guide arranged a Tuk Tuk to transport us about 1 kilometre from where the bus parked to the marker proper. It is very organised in an Indian way. With local vendors selling their wares in front of little shops that open around 10.00am. Once this time passes they disappear and the shop behind starts up. Let us be direct by western standards the smells are just plain awful, but from the locals perspective that is normal. A spice shop we stood in front of was nearly overpowering from the many ground and whole spices on display. The streets are chaotic with Tuk Tuks, motorbikes, wheelbarrows, people, cars, cows, bulls and finally tourists all trying to navigate the broken and uneven ground. To sum up terrific and a must see. Just do not miss the spaghetti of wires where power is distributed, just crazy but apparently safe!!!!
9;NOW THIS IS CROWDED, BUT INTERESTING IN PARTS;As part of our tour we were taken on  a three wheel tuk tuk ride down this crowded,cramped street/alley. Probably no more than a couple of metres wide.<br>The lane was lined either sides by very small shops selling mainly women’s clothing<br><br>This area was built in the 17th century and includes the India’s largest wholesale markets<br><br>Tourists are taken down through this famous market in a three wheel rickshaw. It is crowded and there is really insufficient time to take it all in.constantly hitting holes and bumps in the alley , and narrowly missing similar vehicles coming the other way.<br><br>Once out of this "tourist run" the rest of the tour through the bazaar was relatively interesting. Many spices shops, and small enterprises all trading mainly with locals<br><br>The btuktuk ride really could be dispensed with. A total walking tour would provide more insitre to this bustling and colourful area
9;Not in the morning;Go to Jama Masjid, right in the heart of Old Delhi, and take a rickshaw for a quick exploration . . . just don't do it in the morning (as our guide suggested), because everything is closed. It is a labyrinth of narrow lanes with hundreds of shops, selling everything you'd ever want - and more.<br>In any case, go back later in the evening and try the best of Indian street food.
9;Amazing experience at Chandni Chowk in the evening with Anubhav;What an adventure! We came to India to experience the chaos of colour, smell, and the crowd that we have heard so much about. Going to Chandni Chowk in the evening is the best place to do that, and it blew our expectations. This food tour is much more than what we have expected. <br><br>Anubhav as our guide, and without us knowing, he is like a local celebrity here where we kept encountering people coming up to say hi and took photos with him. We were in good hands, where he brought us all over Chandni Chowk, the spice market, visiting the small food shops and street food stores, local restaurants, going in and out of little alleys while explaining to us every little things that we need to know with knowledge and passion. And he only brought us to places where the food were safe for foreigners like us to consume. <br><br>The market is a very chaotic place, and we would not be able to make sense out of it. We join this tour expecting to sample some local street food, but we got a lot more out of it. It is a glimpse into the life of the local people too.  Highly recommended.
9;Amazing!;If you want to experience the full force of Delhi’s atmosphere, no trip would be complete without a trip to Chandi Chowk. The place can feel insane and overwhelming at times, but the place is full of life and incredible gastronomy: an experience I will never forget! If you’re ever in Delhi, you must visit this fantastic market. It is the adventure of a lifetime.
9;A busy place in heart of Delhi.;A busy place in heart of Delhi. The walkway is good. From 9 am to 9pm only vehicles allowed there are e riksha. So it is relatively less crowded and less polluted. There are shops on both sides of the walkway.  <br>Red fort and parathewali galli are close by.<br>We visited it on July, looks like not so good time to visit.  Winters will be better here. But then it will be so crowded.
9;Tourist coming to Delhi, should spend some hours here;We visited Chandni Chowk several times in November 2021 to purchase bridal dresses. There are specialized specific markets called 'Galis' for most of the items you want to purchase. Both wholesale and retail business go together in a same Gali. Chandni Chowk is well connected with Delhi Metro. Car parking space are few and are always near full. One can not drive car here, as it is not allowed. Chandni Chowk after renovation is easy to walk and enjoy. Red stone is used on the roads which resemble stone used in Red Fort. You can use E-rickshaw to travel there. If we are in here, it is not possible to go back without the taste of Old Delhi. Every Gali or corner has shops, stalls and Khomchas selling local delicious foods. One should always try 3-4 types of items at separate shops. The taste will be there with you forever. Any tourist coming to Delhi, should spend some hours here. Several historical places are there nearby.
9;Must avoid;Worst place.. Nothing to watch or enjoy. Just crowd and thugs. Delhi has many other better places to offer. Try to avoid it
9;Satiate Your Taste Buds;Outstanding place for street food lovers and shopping birds. Come here and satiate your taste buds with chaat and other delicacies.
10;Lovely architecture;Beautiful architecture and grounds. Only chose to visit this site because it was so close to the Lodhi Gardens but so glad that I did. Well worth a visit and some lovely grounds to sit and enjoy
10;Beautiful Ancient Architecture;A beautiful ancient architecture spread in vast place. It is fine example of beautiful Mughal architectures.
10;Beautiful Architecture;Located at a walking distance from Jor Bagh metro station, this is a fine example of beautiful Mughal architecture. The place is clean, well maintained and peaceful as very few people visit this place which is actually quite surprising. A couple of hours visit is recommended. Photography is permitted.
10;Beautiful architecture and history.;This beautiful tomb complex from the late 18th century displays Mughal architecture at its best and is less crowded than other sites around Delhi and Agra. The blend of local sandstone and marble brings out the superb colours depending on the time of day you visit. Allow an hour to take in the complex and enjoy the peace of the grounds. We had a guide which helped with the explanations and history.
10;Stunningly beautiful;I visited on a week day in December at 9 am in the morning . Almost had the place to myself . What an experience !!! Intricate stone carvings , beautiful views and serene views! Loved every minute of it !
10;No crowds while enjoying park like atmosphere;Gorgeous Taj Mahal like structure in a park setting with no crowds. Come hear for great photography, and historical site. We also saw parrots and a peacock while here.
10;Lesser known, but just as impressive;Another huge mausoleum built by a Mogul emperor, Safdarjung, this being the last of the major monuments that include those at Lodhi Gardens and Humayan’s tomb.  Set in a very large walled garden it is an impressive building on the scale of the much more visited, and twice the price, Humayans tomb ,and without the tour groups. A peaceful place to spend a while admiring the striking architecture.
10;Nice place;It's a very nice a good place with a beautiful tomb which is situated in the middle , architecture was very good you can find peace in this area , it's an also good place for photoshoot or video making
10;Beautiful tomb with clean gardens;Beautiful and very well maintained place. The gardens around are also very well maintained and very clean. I went on Saturday at 10PM and met only few people, so I assume the place is not so popular.
10;Safdar jang tomb : mughal architecture;Nice place. Well maintained.People can spend some time here. We went there in the month of November. very few tourist were there .entry fee 25 Rupees for indians.
10;Beautiful garden around the tomb;Tomb is not much maintained, but it's beautiful . Garden around is good to relax. I went for photography.
10;ok;Safdarjung’s Tomb in Delhi is a famous attraction that is made of sandstone and marble mausoleum and it came into existence in 1754 It is open on all days from sunrise to sunset entry For Indians: Rs.15 and for foreigners: Rs.200.
11;Delhi's treasure!;Intercat cravings it was magnificent with details, all on granite stone I think.<br>It was extremely hot in April but was very cooling inside. The detailed cravings on the entrance of the celling was breath taking. A stop should not be missed.
11;Historical interest;Fascinating site, it's worth getting a guide to explain the historical and cultural significance of the area
11;the skyscraper of the past;remarkable construction, a real skyscraper of the past, still functional<br>a Hindu temple transformed in mosque, but the Hindu heritage is still visible<br>and the mystery of the old metallurgy, the iron pillar still not touched by rust<br><br>and a sign of the Hindu behavior - the squirrels are so relaxed, no stress regarding people
11;Amazing history in delhi;I have visited this sight twice in my life, each visit the sun was out and had experienced guides. The  mughal history here alone is something, its the tallest muslim minaret in the world but the ruins were destroyed by an earthquake, its interesting how you can see remnants of hindu architecture.  This is a fascinating place and a must see in Delhi.
11;Worth the visit;I went on a Sunday which I assume is busier than normal. Amazing monument with easy to read information boards.
11;Beautiful place;Beautiful place . <br>Went in the month of Jan. Learnt so much about our history. You can take a a guide also if needed
11;Best place;A true marvel of ancient engineering, Qutub Minar is a must-visit for anyone interested in exploring Delhi's rich cultural heritage.
11;Tall tower;Qutub Minar is an awe-inspiring structure that leaves visitors spellbound with its historical significance and intricate architecture.
11;Quotable minar;Qutub Minar is a must-visit attraction in Delhi. The towering minaret and the surrounding ruins are incredibly impressive and provide a fascinating glimpse into India's rich history and culture.
11;Qutub Minar: A Must-Visit Historical Landmark;Qutub Minar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a must-visit for everyone, including locals of Delhi. Despite its historical and architectural significance, many locals tend to overlook it, taking it for granted. However, the towering structure, which dates back to the early 13th century, is a fascinating sight to behold, with intricate carvings and inscriptions adorning its surface. The surrounding gardens and ruins of ancient structures only add to its charm. Visiting Qutub Minar is a great opportunity to learn about India's rich history and culture, and appreciate the beauty of this magnificent landmark
11;FABULOUS ARCHEALOGICAL SITE. SERENE SURROUNDING;This tower, set in magnificent grounds and containing ruins and remainders of various religions etc, is 73 metres high. The entire area is an archealogical delight with lots of intricate detail inscribed on walls, and the Qutab Minar<br><br> It is a victory tower built in 1193 immediately after the defeat of the last Hindu Kingdom in Delhi.<br><br>The tower if truely magnificent in its own right. There are five quite distinct levels but no cement used. All the bricks are  interlocking. <br><br>The entire area is one where one could relax and simply take in the magnificence and tranquility of the area.<br><br>A definite must see
11;Tallest brick minaret;The Qutub minaret is only a part of this UNESCO complex, which is a wonderful example of early fusion between Muslim and Hindu traditions. Originally build around 1200 in red and grey sandstone, it was later added to and the fourth story is in white marble. It is worth looking at the tower in detail, because it is covered in exquisite calligraphy, decorations, pilasters, balconies and Muqarnas corbels. Depending on the light, it is a gem to photograph from different angles.<br>While the tower is the main drawing card, there are other interesting structures in the complex : the oldest surviving mosque, some columns (leftovers from earlier Hindu temples) and an iron pillar dating back to the 4th century.<br>Easy to spend a few hours taking it all in.

13;I visited this fort in recently in February 2023. It is in the care of Archeological Survey of India. Entry fee is Rs 25;I visited this fort in recently in February 2023. It is in the care of Archeological Survey of India. Entry fee is Rs 25  for Indians, , includes both the fort and Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq tomb.<br>The fort is majestic and covers a huge area maybe half of which is demolished and now covered in forests and residential housing. It is surrounded by a now dried up moat. The outer walls are quite thick.<br>There are a lot of monkeys in the complex. There are also cows that are brought for grazing by the villagers. But i saw the monkeys bother and harass visitors inside the complex and i suggest the authority they should take steps to keep the monkeys away from the site .<br>Opposite the fort is the Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq tomb, formerly part of the same complex but now separated by a road.<br>It is one of the sute of other important sites of Delhi and therefore people interested in architecture and history should come and visit the site .<br>The  ASI should take special care of this monument ,there needs urgent renovation and beautification work in the fort as well as the landscape should be maintain. Thank you<br>Best Regards<br>Mushtaq Pahalgami<br>Social Environmental Activist<br>Travel Consultant from Pahalgam<br>Jammu and Kashmir.
13;A majestic fort, must see but mostly in ruins;I visited this fort in October 2020. Ticketing was via mobile app only due to Covid restrictions. It is in the care of Archeological Survey of India. Entry fee is Rs 20 for Indians, 250 for foreigners, includes both the fort and Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq tomb. There is car parking outside. <br><br>The fort is majestic and covers a huge area of maybe 5-6 sq km, maybe half of which is demolished and now covered in forests and residential housing. It is surrounded by a now dried up moat. The outer walls are quite thick. <br><br>Still, the walls are majestic and the remaining buildings do give an idea of the huge fort. There are a number of buildings at higher and lower levels, including residential areas, kitchen, prisons etc. From one of the higher points in the fort, one can see the entire surrounding countryside. <br><br>There are a lot of monkeys in the complex. There are also cows that are brought for grazing by the villagers. But they dont bother humans anyway. <br><br>Opposite the fort is the Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq tomb, formerly part of the same complex but now separated by a road. <br><br>It is one of the 7 cities of Delhi and therefore a must see for people interested in architecture and history.
13;Tughlaqabad Fort;Driving past the ruins of once grandiose structure known as Tughlaqabad Fort, we decided to take a closer look.<br><br>Upon entering we realized the actual spread of the property, it was massive but falling apart in most places.<br><br>One can  imagine, during its hay days this fort must have been a marvel of sorts, be it the architecture or the raw materials used, it has withstood the test of time since the 14th century. <br><br>A little unsafe though, as other patrons seemed locals, who kept a steady eye on our movement. Intimidated, we decided to cut short our venture and recede back to the parking.<br><br>If you're in a group, then a must visit, since it's not everyday one gets to see a fort or the ruins of it.
13;A Ruined City of Medieval Times;The ruins of the fort tell that the fort actually must have been a city in itself about 700 years back.In fact, 3rd of the 7 cities that Delhi is built around. Big area with ruined rubble masonry structures that will be much more interesting if you connect them with historical stories. Built by Ghiyasuddin Tughlak, founder of Tughlak dynasty in India around 1321, the city was not inhabited for long and was abandoned only after few years. There is a straight causeway to his tomb just across the Mehrauli-Badarpur road. Do wear a good sturdy pair of shoes as you would be walking on rough, uneven, stoney path with thorns that can hurt you. Better to buy online tickets as many times, the tickets would not be issued on the counter. Many local people come here just to enjoy, take selfies and have picnic sort of. But if you are a lover of archaeological sites and history buff, its a must visit site for you in Delhi. The only disappointment to you would be that Archaeological Survey of India has not done anything to educate you by placing information boards/placards at various sites. Sure they have placed one giving the layout of the Fort just at the entrance but its not of much help and difficult to correlate with the actual sites.
13;Jungli;First time we tried to reach the place with a Uber but google maps lead the driver to a shady area on the wrong side of the fort so we thought we'd better desist. We then managed to reach via public transport, with bus 717A from Qtub Minar Metro station stopping at Tughlakabad. <br><br>The man at the ticket counter saw a foreign tourist coming  decided the machine to pay via card was no longer working, so as to keep for himself the extra rupees one has to pay if paying in cash and not card. As we insisted we had no cash he discovered the machine miraculously started functioning again.<br><br>The fort is all ruins and forests, security warning against adventuring in the wilderness and offering their guidance and protection in exchange for tips. The Mausoleum of Ghiyat al-Din on the other side of the road, instead, is really well kept. I get the fascination for lonesome forgotten ruins, but unfortunately that brings great concerns for safety, especially in Delhi.
13;Amazing!?!;Absolutely worth a visit. Metro and tuc tuc and you are straight there, there's some 'climbing'/rough ground, so decent shoes called for.
13;Interesting almost forgotten history;The 3rd city of Delhi. Hard to find any concrete information on the history of this fort. Lots of talk tales and legends. Built in the 1300’s and cursed to be forever uninhabited, it was meant to protect the people from invasion and could withstand a siege for years.  Nothing much left to see but the great walls, an unfinished well, and a serious of mysterious underground passages ways.
13;The Best Ancient Monument in Delhi !;Tughlaqabad Fort is so under rated.  You could spend a whole day here and still not see it all.  Tughlaqabad is one of Delhi's ancient citadels, this one dates around 1321 or thereabouts.  It includes the main Tughlaqabad Fort, the mausoleum of Ghiyasuddin across the road, and the Adilabad fort slightly further away.<br><br>This is not a popular sightseeing attraction, so if you come on a weekday in the morning hours you arent likely to see too many other people around.  Needless to say being Delhi, this gives rise to safety issues and we werent surprised to see an armed guard near the entrance.  Fortunately there are several ASI guards inside and it's a good idea to engage one of them as an unofficial guide (negotiable but very reasonable rates), especially if its your first visit and you havent a clue where to begin because the site is really spread out and fairly densely wooded.  Plenty of cute monkeys were around but they were minding their own business.  I expect if you display food, they might come for a free snack!<br><br>There is enough info about the antiquity of the fort so I will not go into that.  I just loved the ruins, the sprawling expanse, the massive ramparts and the wonderful feeling of stepping back in time that ancient stone structures often exude.  <br><br>We could not spare more than 2-1/2 hrs so it was good that we had the guard to take us around the main places inside.  This included two underground tunnels, a couple of towers and two deep wells.  Didnt have time to see the mausoleum across the road where apparently you can also spot Nilgai.<br><br>The weather was overcast with a slight chill, making it perfect for wandering around.  Sturdy walking shoes are a must.  I look forward to spending an entire day here, cool weather permitting, on my next visit to Delhi.  This is the best of all the Delhi ancient sites I have seen.<br><br>Not suitable for the disabled or anyone having difficulty with walking.  If you have young children running around, do keep a sharp eye on them, there are very deep wells and hidden openings to underground passages.<br><br>We came by taxi on our way to the airport.  Not sure about public transport. there were plenty of auto rickshaws on the main Mehrauli Badarpur Road.  Didn't see any toilets but there is enough wild growth around if you must go you know where.  You can buy food and water bottles from the hawkers outside and pack your picnic.
13;Off the Grid. Beautiful Ruins!;Situated on the outskirt of New Delhi, this amazingly beautiful ruins of 13th century has a lot to offer. Apart from being an amazing fort, it also offers great opportunity for photoshoot. The ruins of Tughlaqabad is bifurcated by Mehrauli Badarpur Road. On one side is the Mausoleum Of Ghiyaz ud din Tughlaq, while the on the other side is the ruins of actual fort. From atop this fort you can view Delhi. Neglected heritage. Need more of attention and proper care. There is an entry fees which is minimal. Parking is free. Not much of shop nearby. Carry water bottle and wear comfortable shoes
13;Another priceless site ignored and neglected;One more monument neglected, ill maintained and left to fight the elements, to say nothing of the unruly locals. Once again, no toilets, no guides and no publicity. No decent eatery in the neighbourhood. Consequently, few visitors. The fort has an interesting history and could attract large number of visitors if professional guides were available. With the neighbouring Ghiyasuddin's Tomb, which is rather well maintained, and Adilabad Fort, it could earn fabulous revenue.
13;Offbeat destination, great photo opportunity;I loved it, not only was it was it not crowded it was spectacularly beautiful.  Definately recommend it to you in the winter months, as it requires lots of walking.  Please take along a guide as he shows you hidden corners which otherwise you might miss. An offbeaten historical site, I recommend it as well as a great photo shoot sight especially for pre wedding snaps.
13;A glimpse into the history of Delhi;It's said the term "Ab Dilli door nahi" dates back to the Delhi during Tughlaq. That would make the fort of Tughlaqabad the city itself. Even though it now stands as a ruin in south-central Delhi, it is still magnificent. It still overlooks the city, and the parts that survive look majestic. A gate leads to a well-kept path that runs through the accessible parts of the fort. Be sure to take a peek at the narrow passage that goes below ground level, and the high turret from where you can see just how massive this fort once was.<br>Don't miss the baoli hidden behind some wild shrubbery (to the left of the entrance).
14;Temple visit;Absolutely stunning place.  No photography is permitted, but don't miss the beauty of this building and its surrounds, it'll take your breath away.
14;A must do.;Amazing temple. The biggest one in east. I really enjoyed the colours and the quietness of the place. Everything is very organised. Please keep in mind that you won’t be able to enter with electronic devices.
14;Beautiful;Very big and beautiful temple. I would suggest,if you wanna visit this temple, go there in evening and enjoy the water show. Its just amazing worth to watch.
14;Akshardham Temple;Must visit temple. It's one of the biggest temple in the world. Peaceful, neat and clean, well maintained.<br>Water show, film, boat ride and other shows are worth seeing .<br>Nothing allowed inside the temple except transparent water bottle and infant's food. There is also Cloak Room for keeping the belongings. <br>Entry fee for the shows Rs 250, Rs 200 for senior citizens.<br>In the Food court we can enjoy our favourite food at reasonable price.<br>Ample parking space available, no problem at all.

14;One of the most impressive places I have seen;Cannot leave Delhi without seen this. The degree of detail in the construction is amazing, thousands a small sulpted characters lining the walls.
14;Hidden treasure in Delhi;What a place, worth visiting but it's such a shame that one cannot take any photos inside the temple as it is beautiful.<br>I would also recommend the food they serve as it is reasonably priced and tasty.
14;A Must Visit Place in Delhi For a Lifetime Experience;We visited Akshardham when our son had come from US. From Ghaziabad, we hired a cab and reached this great and imposing temple at about 2 PM as we also wanted to stay there till the Laser show timings. There is too much security around Akshardham. After parking the car, we were directed to proceed to reception. There we had to keep our mobile phones for which, a receipt was given. Larger bags are also to be deposited here. As we had not taken lunch before leaving home, we went to the canteen, which was crowded. Lot of variety is available here, both north Indian and south Indian but the food is available only  through self service. Then we went inside and as guided, visited several halls where audio-visual illustrations are done about the saint Swaminarayan, who left his family, denounced the worldly pleasures and devoted his life for the service of mankind. There are also some pavilions where the visitors are taken around and life of many Hindu Gods, Such as Rama, Krishna and Shiva are beautifully depicted through attractive tableaus. Visit to all these Halls took about 3 hours and then we again went to canteen to take tea  and pass some time. Though many visitors  were seen to be leaving the temple premises but we also found new visitors entering the premises and sitting in the central arena. we also went to the central open air theater where a Laser or water Show was to commence after sunset. We took good positions and had to wait about one hour when the show began. To our surprise we found that the crowd started swelled each minute as if they were waiting for this show and hundreds of students started thronging the place. In fact there were much more numbers to watch this display rather than the people visiting the main temple in the afternoon. This display was really marvelous and worth the money that we had spent for the tickets. In fact there are separate tickets for this show. A mythological and popular story was very beautifully narrated through colored laser lights and water fountains. The display was really mesmerizing. It was a great experience for us  and I strongly  recommend the visit to Akshardham at least for this evening water-cum-laser show.<br><br>The sad part is that one cannot take the photos as cameras and mobiles are not allowed.
14;Do not miss;Beautiful place to visit. Neat- clean and efficiently run. You need to store your mobile phone/ electronics which is slightly bothersome. Do not miss the view at night and the fountain show.
15;Bustling Anglican Church in New Delhi;Visited on a sunday and it was heaving outside on the well kept lawns and garden with sequential attenders - as services are held throughout the am in Hindi, Tamil, English ....Relaxed atmosphere. Praise group of young adults and they led some of service. Yes it is somewhat round the back of the rashtrapati bhavan- so prepare for a long walk  around or get in + possible rampant monkey troups or get a richshaw who knows where it is!! as the security means you have to walk around the govt. buildlings to access it. There are loos in the adjacent building if open people will politely let you use. Benches to sit in grounds + Colgate squirrels on  the trees!
15;Aplendid Arches Inside;This very English looking cathedral was built  around 1930 and is stylish with wide arches and pillars. A bit tricky to get into if you are there other than a Sunday as there are locked gates and the guards were reluctant tolet us in however did in the end. It is in a quiet and peaceful area of Delhi. The unlocked cathedral haa a large organ from the 1930's too. Servies in English and Hindi and occasionally other languages.
15;Great church with a lovely congregation;Came to a couple of services here. Three services, the earliest of which is in English, which is then followed by a Hindi service. Contemporary worship in the evening. Enjoyed all the services, and there is a very fine organ. Lovely building as well. Congregation was very nice, warm and welcoming.
15;Beautiful Church;A beautiful church around Connaught place. Amazing architecture. Next to parliament. A very lovely, peaceful and beautiful place to be. Worth visiting once. you'll get very fewer people there. The restriction is you can only spend some considerable amount of time inside with proper diary maintained with the name and addresses of the visitors.
15;Infront of President's House;This is a beautiful piece of architecture situated just Infront of entry of Rashtrapati Bhavan. This church is a marvelous creation, wonderfully designed and till today preserved well.
15;Cathedral Church of the Redemption;Cathedral Church of the Redemption comes under the Church of North India (CNI). It’s a fine example of British era architecture built somewhere in early 19th century.
15;Remembering the son of God;It is called Viceroy church by locals as was used by Viceroy of India during British rule, located near Parliament house and Rashtrapati Bhavan of New Delhi. Spectacular design made this church one of the finest in India, and remains cool inside during hot summer. <br>The church manages many schools and hospitals in Delhi. People, mainly Christians celebrate different ceremonies here in different occasions. It's a place of tourist interest in Delhi.
15;Beautiful building;It is a Beautiful building, well maintained and clean. <br>Some information about its history should have been available for tourists to read about.
15;Calmness and Divine;Feel the divine and calmness within you and around in this beautiful church! Loved the architecture and sitting style which is very traditional.
15;magnificent.;overall this is one o the beautiful church in the city.this is located next to rashtravpati Bhawan and Parliament House on Church Road.<br>The architecture is beautiful.
15;Quiet and clam;Although I am born in Delhi and visited most of places in Delhi but this place I have visited only recently, although I have passed this place thousand times but unfortunately could not  go inside. This weekend I had opportunity to visit this place . There is parking facility inside as well as outside. The place is very nicely developed and maintained both inside and outside the church.
15;Historical place is under renovation;This historical church was opened to public on January 18, 1931 and is located to the east of President's House. It is a magnificent structure, which is under renovation and closed for public for few more days.
16;all respect for those guys;usually people are interested to gain for themselves, but that temple is a place to offer for others, for free - food and strong emotions, day by day, without stop<br>it's a place of empathy for people, no matter what kind of people - empathy for soul and body needs<br>this temple is not about a building, it's a good example that the good is possible
16;Gurudwara sahib;It's always an amazing experience to visit this historic Guridwara sahib. We visited on Tuesday so got a good darshan as it was not very crowded. Weekends are quite busy. Tranquil and peaceful, soul soothing
16;Calming and peaceful;Beautiful gurudwara, surroundings, water and environment so calming and peaceful.<br>If you want to see a beautiful spritual place, bangla saheb is the best option. Also please try langar too
16;jo bole so nihal sat sri akal;Inner peace<br><br>Gurudwara Bangla Sahib is a Sikh temple located in the heart of New Delhi. It's known for its stunning golden dome and beautiful architecture. Visitors are welcome to enter and explore the temple grounds, where they can learn about Sikhism and participate in prayer and meditation. The temple also offers free food and drinks to visitors, a tradition known as Langar. Many visitors find the experience at Gurudwara Bangla Sahib to be peaceful and spiritual, and it's a must-visit destination for those interested in learning more about Sikh culture and traditions.
16;Unforgettable visit to Sikh gurdwara;The temple and the grounds are very beautiful and should be a part of every visitor's visit to Delhi. The mission of this temple includes feeding anybody who wishes to eat here and providing free medical care. <br>It is a place of assembly and worship for Sikhs.<br>There is a fee to enter. Everybody, including all men, have to wear a special head cover. There is a place for foreigners to leave their shoes and backpacks. Free head cover is provided but we bought ours at the adjacent bazaar leading to the temple entrance.<br>We were allowed to visit the kitchen complex and it is indeed an amazing, well-organized place. The temple feeds up to thirty thousand people daily. The food is prepared fresh and from good natural ingredients. We had the opportunity to participate in food preparation process. <br>It is very pleasant to stroll through the grounds of Gurudwara Bangla Sahib. We walked around the large holy pond Sarovar and admired the golden dome of the temple.<br>The atmosphere is friendly and pleasant all around. The visit to this temple leaves most visitors with renewed spirit of believe in goodness of humanity. <br>Gurudwara Bangla Sahib is located near Sacred Heart Cathedral and Connaught Place.
16;A large and famous gurudwara in Delhi.;This is where one of the Sikh gurus spent time helping the poor and needy during epidemics and food shortages. It is sacred to the Sikhs and now many pilgrims come to pay their respects, and to walk in the waters that flow through the site. As with all gurudwaras, this one provides free food to all who ask for it, and it is said that over thirty thousand people eat here daily. The gurudwara also provides medical care to those who need it. For those who visit, they should remember to be respectful and to not take pictures inside the durbar hall, as well as having all men cover their heads with one of the free head coverings provided.
16;Not to be missed";Any major Gurudwara in India comes across as a disciplined and calm place sans beggars and trouble mongers. Gurudwara sahib is no exception. It's a huge property teeming with devotees. One need not walk an appreciable distance to gain entry into the darbar which is the main worship hall. The darshan takes a few minutes, no pushing or pulling. Down, the beautiful area filled with the holy pond or sarovar  is a sight for the sore eyes. Can't miss the delicious  prasad or Kada Prasad. <br><br>There is no entry fee, plan to stay for at least two hours, you'll love the place. Best to visit in the night. One has to cover the head with a scarf. Cameras and phone can be carried but one is not allowed to click photos, though the rule is not strictly enforced.  Footwears need to be deposited at designated places. <br><br>People are helpful, a sense of bonhomie pervades the entire place. A must visit in Delhi.
16;Hospitality plus provide a platform for our readers to get daily news about Pakistan. All updates of Hotel management, T;Gurudwara Bangla Sahib ( listen) is one of the most prominent Sikh gurdwaras, or Sikh house of worship, in Delhi, India, and known for its association with the eighth Sikh Guru, Guru Har Krishan, as well as the holy pond inside its complex, known as the "Sarovar."
16;A very unusual experience;RELIGIONS vary across the world, but when I went to what was one of Delhi's most prominent places of Sikh worship I really had to concentrate.<br>For a start, there were nearly 70,000 people in the site.<br>Secondly, while I was used to taking my shoes off to visit various sites across India, I had never been asked to take my socks off as well as covering my hair.<br>It was no big deal.....until I came to the large tray of water in which I was supposed to step to purify my feet.<br>I am well aware of the opposing significance of feet and head in different religions, but I am still Western and religion wasn't uppermost in  my mind when I dutifully stepped into the water tray at the entrance.<br>Instead all I could focus on was how the water had been turned into a sort of soup by the passage of tens of thousands of feet before me. I hope Sikh people respect my concerns the same way I respected their religion.<br>Once through this mental obstacle I had a few other things to occupy my mind including how I could ever take my next step.<br>The place was absolutely rammed, packed with worshippers, many of whom took advantage of the incredible amount of free meals being benevolently dispensed at the kitchen area which did brisk business.<br>In some places it was so packed you were almost carried forward in a dense crowd of people keen to do everything from stroll round the central holy pond to buying religious souvenirs.<br>The smell of sweat and the press of bodies did create a feeling of claustrophobia at times, but I shook it off because I needed to keep track of my guide. There were so many people there that I lost him three times.<br>Finally I completed my visit and went and collected my socks and trainers only to meet an official interested in explaining Sikh religion to me.<br>I listened and even took away a leaflet which allows me to tell you that the word "Sikh" means "disciple", a person who believes in one god and the teachings of the Ten Gurus enshrined in the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh Holy Book.<br>We chatted for a while and then I followed my guide out of the site to reach a different state of mental enlightenment, one where I didn't feel as much of the overpowering presence of religious fervour as I had in the temple.<br>Definitely an experience I will not forget, but if you go to this temple be prepared for a demanding experience.<br>A side issue is that no photography is allowed in the main areas.
16;Beautiful religious place;We were looking forward to this visit and it was really a great experience<br>Everything is so well managed and the entire area is kept very clean<br>Although there was a large crowd, it was managed really well<br><br>The access is good, ample parking is available and you will not be pestered by guides here. You will left to your own which is the way it should be at any place of worship
16;Speechless by hospitality;This Sikh temple and the people inside of this premises are the best ones I've ever met. <br>They are great to please their hospitality and the amount of food they made every single day is unimaginable.
16;Peaceful but hot floor;No one attempted to scam me here which was breathe of fresh air, very calm and peaceful. Floor was very hot midday, burned my feet but worth it. Strict rules, cover head using a scarf from the scarf bin, no hats or shorts. I did try to carry my shoes around because i was fearful after my Jama Masjid experience but a nice man politely told me to please use the communal space for shoes and i did at of respect.
17;Worth the visit for darshan;A beautiful architectural temple.  It was very crowded on the date we went and no social distancing but than Lord Krishna looks after his devotees. Wanted to eat at Govinda but very limited menu esp for dietary needs.
17;Mesemerizing Temple Architect;The laser show is well made but very boring experience for an hour and everywhere one needs to stand. The temple was closed so could not pray. The souvenir shop is average. Parking lot is quite Co fusing to park the car and to get out of the parking lot is even more confusing, no dedicated person in the parking lot on both entrance and exit, you need to navigate your own way out of this place. The temple is well made but it’s overrated, A bunch of woman was selling books and giving out for free, I too, it then they asked for money, the price of the book was 350 but I had only 500 and they took the money and didn’t have any change. Felt kind of cheated but then thought given to ISKCON charitable foundation, so I let it be.
17;International Society of Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) | Delhi;ISKCON is a must-visit Hindu temple devoted to Lord Krishna.  It is a peaceful place where almost every day Har-e-Krishna chant is sung. You can also be part of the Bhagavad Gita show.
17;Spiritual grounding and refueling with renewed energy;Recommended to visit. Part being renovated. Still has an ambient atmosphere of peace, communion and spiritual connection. Prayers going on inside temple. Vibrant murti and ceremonial darshan. Walking barefoot helps ground the energy while the immersion in the crowd fills us up with positive vibes.
17;Beautiful Temple;Such a marvellous temple with beautifully decorated interiors. The temple complex is very neat and clean. You will feel peace and positive vibes once you enter inside. The closest metro station is Nehru Place.
17;Ecastic;It's being always an incredible experience to be a part of the temple visit. Quite exceptional, enchanting with Hare Krishna hyms altogether different ecstatic
17;Usual iskcon temple;This is my 4th metro Iskcon temple visit,it is usual as per Iskcon standard. The arrangement of paid prasadam is good. Parking facility is good and surprisingly free.
17;Wonderful Gathering!!;It's being sunny winters. Experience with people who visited the temple. Hare Krishna! <br>Keep share your valuable time here
17;Need to avoid commercialisation of Holy place;Temple is very good and soothing in many ways but the thing which is very annoying and ridiculous about the place is unnecessary stalls of books like Gita, CDs which people are selling forcefully in the name of charity and get into arguments and force people for buying it.' Charity is something which can't be forced on anyone, it is a feeling which comes naturally'. <br><br>Above all this, there is a Light and Sound Show: which I think is built to make it in the way 'Sahaj Anand Show' in Akshardham, but trust me it is nowhere near that. Moreover, it is waste of money(which they only take in CASH without giving any receipt, which they don't even tell on call to anyone if called on there customer care) Rs: 200/per head and mind you Show in Akshardham is cost 170 RS(which they take via any medium along with receipt ) and is way way better than this
17;Great Buzz;We stopped over for darshan and lunch at the temple. What a great experience. The mood in the temple is one of celebration and joy. We were met with warmth, love and care all around. The meals were superb and very well priced. Will definitely go back.
17;Impressive Structure and Grounds;<br>While visiting the Lotus Temple we extended our stay and walked to the Iskcon Temple situated on the same grounds and very close.<br><br>The main alter was closed when we arrived but we were able to wander around and explore the grounds.  Impressive temple and a peaceful place to visit.<br><br>Sri Sri Radha Parthasarathi Mandir, generally known as the ISKCON Delhi temple, is a well known Vaishnav temple of Lord&nbsp. Krishna and Radharani in the form of and Radha Parthasarathi. The Temple was inaugurated on 5 April, 1998 by the then Prime Minister of India and Atal Bihari Vajpayee. It is located at Hare Krishna Hills (near and Nehru Place metro stop.
17;nice;ISKCON is an association belonging to Hare Rama Hare Krishna fad The Iskcon Temple is a spectacular shrine located in Delhi constituted to be the best tourist places in Delhi. visit the temple throughout the week in between 4.30 am to 9 pm
18;WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE TO VISIT AND OBSERVE;The Masjid-i-Jehan-Numa (lit. 'World-reflecting Mosque'), is commonly known as the Jama Masjid of Delhi, is one of the largest mosques in India.[1]<br><br>The mosque was  built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan between 1650 and 1656, and inaugurated by its first Imam, Syed Abdul Ghafoor Shah Bukhari. It is situated in the centre of Delhi not far from the Red Fort.  It served as the imperial mosque of the Mughal emperors until the demise of that empire in 1857. The Jama Masjid was regarded as a symbolic node of Islamic power across India, well into the colonial era. It was also a site of political significance during several key periods of British rule. It remains in active use, and is one of Delhi's most iconic sites, closely identified with the ethos of Old Delhi.<br><br>This is a fascinating site, as a mosque it is capable ofaccommodating 25000 worshippers in the outdoor courtyard.<br><br>A dress code is applied, ie no bare legs, bare arms etc. To provide for this a modest covering can be hired at a very minimal costs.<br><br>We wre not allowed entry to the mosque itself unless worshipping. This was somewhat disappointing .
18;Historical site;Another Shah Jahan, constructed in his favorite colors, red (sandstone) and white (marble), and located in the center of Old Delhi. It is very elegant with its onion-domes and minarets. As in most active religious sites, one has to show respect by covering up and taking off shoes (not always pleasant stepping through pigeon droppings on the hot pavement).<br>The whole complex is accessible through 3 gates and is build around a large courtyard . in the middle lies a large ablution tank. It certainly pays to spend a little time in the prayer hall to admire the calligraphy, seven mihrabs and especially the marble floor, which looks like a prayer mat.
18;Beautiful Building and my first visit to a Mosque;Although I didn't spend a lot of time there, it is a beautiful mosque in Central Delhi built during the Mughal period and even though there were lots of people visiting it, it wasn't chaotically busy and the mosque was relatively clean and well maintained despite its age. Was also my very first visit to a mosque and there were some nice views of the Red Fort from the sides of the building and it was relatively easy to get around.
18;India's Largest Mosque;Jama Masjid is a spectacular mosque of India which was built by Emperor Shah Jahan in Delhi. Construction started in 1644 and completed by 1656. Jama Masjid is situated in the heart of Central Delhi and is located at walkable distance from Red Fort. One can reach here by Delhi Metro and Jama Masjid stations falls on the Violet Metro Line route.<br><br>Architecture of Jama Masjid:<br>Jama Masjid is built in Indo-Islamic style, facing west and oriented towards the holy city Mecca. This is made with Red Sand stone and white Marbles. A Brilliant Mughal Architecture, Ostad Khalil was Architecture for this Masjid Also. Shah Jahan built three massive arched gates, marble domes, two giant minarets and four small minarets. Jama Masjid has total three entrances on East, North and South. North and South gates are regularly used by visitors while the East gate, right across the road from the Rod fort is opened on Every Friday only.<br><br>Interesting Facts about Jama Masjid:<br>1. This Mosque is largest Mosque of India which can hold up to 25,000 people at a time.<br>2. Approx. Construction cost at that time was 10 Lakh Rupees and around 5000 workers were involved in this construction and same was supervised by Saadullah Khan, who was the Emperor's Prime Minister at that time.<br>3. This Mosque was inaugurated on 23rd July 1656 by Abdul Ghafoor Shah Bukhari who was an Imam whom Shah Jahan invited from Uzbekistan. <br>4. This Mosque was initially called Masjid-I- Jahan Numa, meaning "The mosque that reflects the World". Later same was named Jama Masjid and also called as Friday Mosque.<br>5. It is believed that Shah Jahan built this Masjid to promote unity in the world. Jama Masjid was the final architectural triumph of Shah Jahan.<br>6. Jama Masjid has survived two terrorist attacks. in 2006 a bomb explosion took place and in 2010 Firing happened.<br><br>Timings:<br>Morning 07:00-12:00 and Evening 01:30-06:30
18;old Delhi vibes - what an amazing place;this is the biggest mosque in India. we went there around 4pm in the evening. it is a beautiful sight at sunset. <br>of course, there will be lot of crowds visiting here all the time. but there are many entrances. <br>you will get a battery operated rickshaw taking you from red fort to the mosque entrance.<br>A dress code is there. you cannot wear short pants, three fourths pants are not allowed.<br>Full pants (covering the knee) is required. you cannot wear shoes inside the place of worship.
18;Jumu masjid the great!;A very beautiful and historical cum spiritual site,The memory will live with me for the rest of my days is cool and highly magnificent the architectural design is full of wonders considering the time of construction
18;Isabelle (France);We visited the beautiful Jama Masjid, which is the largest mosque in India. It is located in the heart of Old Delhi and represents the reveals the splendor of the Mughal dynasty.<br>We were impressed by this beautiful red sandstone and white marble monument with its two 40 meter high minarets and bulbous domes.<br>From the esplanade, we saw a large courtyard with basins where the faithfuls do their ablution before praying.<br>To visit the mosque, we had to take off shoes, cover our arms/legs and respect the silence.<br>A sumptuous and dazzling mosque!
18;Mosque;It is one of the largest mosque of India. built by Shah Jahan and constructed with red sandstone and white marble
18;Rude behaviour of care taker of Jams Masjid Ziyarat Area;One of the Care taker of Jama Masjid of Ziyarat area was very rude Today. May Allah guide all of us. If you are seeing this comment please dont take it in a  wrong way. <br><br>If a Non Muslim or less aware Muslim is not using most sophisticated words for Islam or Prophet (SAW) . That may be due to lack of knowledge. So, our duty as ummah is to correct them in best way at first.<br><br>You guys are our representatives kind of. Because you interact with many people every day as a More practising Muslim and close to Muhammad (SAW) character.<br><br>Thanks,
18;Greedy administrators;They are very racist at the door. They just want money from you if you have white skin. They don't even know if you are a resident of India or a Muslim... In the moment they see your face they ask for money and there is not any place written that foreigners have to pay. The only sign is about if you go inside with a camera or phone you have to pay, they don't mention your nationality or religion. However, I repeat, they charge just to foreigners. This is call RACISM and DISCRIMINATION.<br>It's a shame because Islam doesn't teach to be greedy. The mosque is a place for praying, not to make business! <br>The people in charge of the administration of the Jama Masjid should be ashamed!
18;Nice start to a visit of Chandni Chowk;Nice start to a visit of Chandni Chowk. The mosque is right next to the old city centre. The building itself is quite nice, but not extraordinary. Great place to watch people, especially in the streets around the mosque. You need to take of your shoes and have to pay a small fee for taking in cameras.
18;Big mosque in the middle of the city;It is our first stop in our New Delhi trip. It is located int he middle of the city and the mosque is elevated that you need to take the stairs. They also have a security check so it is best not to have a bag with you for easy entry.<br><br>To enter the mosque, you need to take off your shoes. Either you enter barefoot or with socks. We were told that we can use the hotel slippers so some brought it.<br><br>You also need to think about what to wear as sleeveless shirt and shorts are not allowed. I suggest you bring extra clothes with you (if you want) to conform with the rules. Although scarfs and garments are available at the entrance for free, I suggest you bring your own for hygienic purposes!<br><br>The mosque is really big and impressive. The color is also nice. Although it is a warm day, the stones are not really hot. You are free to roam around and explore.
19;Impressive, well-run temple;An amazing and spiritual experience.  Well-run, they move people quickly into the temple.  You must take off your shoes and store them in the bags provided.  No cost.  Air conditioned.
19;So beautiful temple;The beautiful gardens surrounding the lotus temple.<br>But sad footwear management systems.<br>Overall one of the cleanest monument in India .
19;So very peaceful;Amazing place to visit, how it is built will amaze you and so very peaceful inside, a wonderful place to visit
19;Quick visit only needed.;Beautiful, Inside is super plain so you can literally get dropped off at the gate, enter in the que and then quickly see the visitors centre in 15 min and then take pictures of the temple and leave. <br><br>If you chose to go in, be aware, you have to take your shoes off halfway and put them in a bag and then drop them at a shoe drop. This is chaotic and very tight space. It sort of put me off the entire experience. Then going inside you have to que again. <br><br>The best part is the picture from the outside. So we saw the visitor centre and the temple in under 30 min.
19;Beautiful place;The temple is a popular destination for people of all faiths,  providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all.
19;Stunning place in Delhi;The stunning architecture of the temple, inspired by the lotus flower, is a true marvel that never fails to impress visitors.
19;Lotus temple;The beautiful gardens surrounding the lotus temple. It was so peaceful. Enjoyed the walk upto the lotus temple itself.
19;Amazing tranquility in the heart of Delhi;Visited here pre-Covid on a day off from a work trip. The architecture is absolutely stunning. You usually have to queue to get in, but it’s worth it just to see such a unique building up close. If you’re in the area it’s well worth a visit.
19;Nice;Nice place to visit we have wait there 30 minute it's fells very calm and chilling ness so it's very nice .   It's like God have made this
19;Worth the trip;Lovely half hour spent in a park like setting.  The Lotus temple is lovely, the architecture is more modern and interesting.  There is a bit of a walk from where you enter. There are also stairs to get up to the temple entrance.  You will line up in groups, and then be allowed into the temple for 10 minutes.  There is no talking permitted inside.  And that's it....the grounds are cordoned off...so no wandering around in the gorgeous gardens.  You will be corralled back down the stairs, shoes returned and then off you go.  It was really better than it sounds.  The grounds are beautifully kept and the Temple itself is gorgeous.
19;Stunning Building;An absolutely stunning building, incredibly impressive as you approach through the landscaped gardens. Interesting to see inside and experience the temple.
19;Over hyped place;One of the better places to visit in Delhi. Most of the architecture in Delhi is bad. This one has been designed by a foreigner and has been built well. Maintenance however is poor. Urinals were overflowing, poor queue management systems, and sad footwear management systems. They don't even plant shady trees for people to sit in the shade when the rush is heavy. Instead, all the lawns are kept off limits to people. The place is spiritual and you do feel the energy inside the main area. However, children bawling and people talking on the phone, disturb the atmosphere. Several couples were actually on a date in the prayer room. Visit for the architecture and design. Rest all is okayish.
20;Oldest Church in Delhi.;Near to the Kashmere Gate and standing in it's own grounds, St. James's Church is also known as Skinner's Church due to it's founder being  James Skinner who, being of mixed Indian/ Scottish parentage, was shunned by the British army so created his own calvary division. Being badly wounded in a military engagement, he vowed to found a church if he recovered.<br> This being the case, St. James's was built and consecrated in 1836.<br>    The church exterior is painted yellow and white, yellow being the colour of " Skinner's Horse ", as his calvary was known. Indeed , it still exists within the Indian Army and his relatives still live in India.<br>  Interesting interior with Skinner's cenotaph in front of the altar and plaques on the walls commemorating  some of those who fell in the Mutiny of 1857.<br>  The grounds are rather scruffy and contain a small, railed off set of tombs, some bearing the name Skinner. Shamefully, some rubbish chucked up on some of them.<br>  I found the grounds shut for lunch when I arrived and gained access at 2:30 pm. Worth remembering. Very near to the confusingly multiple exit/entrance Kashmere Gate Metro station.
20;Skinner's Church - Impressive;St James's Church - or Skinner's Church after Colonel JamesSkinner of Skinner's Horse -is a well maintained heritage building near the Kashmir Gate in Old Delhi. With links to the Indian Mutiny indicated by many plaques in memory of those who lost those lives in 1857 it is an important part of any 'Mutiny Tour' in Delhi. Until the 1930s the Viceroys used to worship here. Well worth a visit. No charge but a donation to the upkeep is most welcome.
20;oldest church of delhi;Church of "Saint James" built by victorious British soldiers to thank the mercy of God after the bloody war of 1857
20;Amazing  and must visit when in Delhi- oldest Living Church in delhi;St. James Church is believed to be the oldest surviving Church of Delhi. The beautiful imposing sturucture is a major landmark in North Delhi. Also, it has some really interesting stories associated with it. It was constructed by James Skinner, the son of a Scottish father and a Rajput mother. James Skinner, a Maratha Colonel, got badly injured in a war in the early 19th century. He prayed to God and promised that if he survived, he would build a church as a commemoration of his faith in God. Fortunately he survived and as promised, he built as church, which is now known as the Delhi Saint James Church. The compound of the St. James Church still houses the grave of James Skinner, in front of the altar.

21;History is always magical;One of the best museums of Delhi, full of artifacts, interactive zones, visual demonstrative objects.<br><br>Best thing is centrally located in Delhi.
21;Very good museum;I was in the National Museum in the month of January with my friends to explore and this one was one of the best museums, we had visited. Indus gallery, miniature gallery, decorative arts galleries were so eye-catching. One can learn so much from the museums. Artefacts were very well exhibited and has got a wonderful atmosphere overall.
21;New Delhi Art;Part of this museum is located in a stunning venue the Jaisalmer House!<br>The rest of the museum is in a building that seems to need sprucing up! <br>The art works themselves are outstanding but once again need better lighting/ display etc.<br>For a world class art collection more thought to be given to the overall esthetics.
21;Ok;500 rupees for foreign nationals. Lots of stuff under construction though. They have free guided tours at 10am and 2:30pm. I was hoping to get some sort of start to finish history of the diverse regions of India but that's not really the experience here. Lots of artifacts to see but not a ton of context.
21;A must visit place for Delhi Trip;It is the largest museum in India and is considered as the hub of Indian art, culture and history. It has over 200,000 exhibits including sculptures, manuscripts, paintings, and other artifacts that date back to the Indus Valley Civilization.
21;Pathetic museum, nothing really to see.;Not worth visiting the place. Ome of the worst museum I've ever visited. Presumably, the British stole everything and they have nothing to display. It has a bunch of clay bows, coins and plenty of statutes of, I guess, their deities in all forms and out of all kinds of materials.<br>There were only a couple of visitors besides me.
21;Relics from an ancient civilisation;Set up in 1949, this National Museum houses over 2 million artefacts from the ancient civilisation. On display are the Relics of the Buddha (5th to 4th BCE), unearthed in Uttar Pradesh. Outstanding specimens of Buddhist Art, illustrated through almost 100 exhibits in stone, bronze, terracotta, stucco and painted scrolls. The artefacts represent Buddhist arts of Nepal, Tibet, Central Asia, Myanmar, Java and Cambodia. Many of these relics stimulate a sense of devotion, dedication and love for humanity. <br><br>I am eternally blessed to have personally seen the beautiful Buddhist Art in New Delhi. I remain deeply humbled by the teachings of Gautama Buddha. <br>
21;Must Visit Place;It has a huge collection of sculptors, coins, paintings, etc right from Indus Valley Civilization to modern history of India nicely distributed among different galleries. For someone who is interested in the history and culture of India, this is a must visit place. At least 3 - 4 hours are required to go through all the sections.
21;Maybe it's interest dependent, but frankly I found the curation quite lacking;I've been to a few museums around the world, Rijksmuseum in the Netherlands being my favorite so far. The National Museum of Delhi was on my list for some time and spent a Saturday here with a friend, its quite covid safe and fairly empty. So was, in my humble opinion, the heart in it.<br><br>Why this Museum needs an overhaul 1:<br><br>I love museums because they put you in the middle of a world, it can be imaginative, inspiring. The National museum of Delhi felt like it was me in a lot of rooms, rummaging through artefacts.<br><br>Excavations of pots, pillars, sculptures since 5000 BC arranged as a disconnected set of artefacts across about 12 departments.<br><br>Why this Museum needs an overhaul 2:<br><br>We are thriving in the 21st century between technology and connectivity. The biggest Museum in Delhi deserves a good medium for audio guides - they immensely compliment the experience and are barely any expense or effort to provide consistently. If you do it like I did - you might end up toggling Youtube and the HopOn India App QR codes which are sporadically placed and usually unrelated to each other.<br><br>I wish I could contribute in some way to improve India's biggest Museum
21;largest museum;Situated on Janpath, includes varieties of arts and crafts, you can find 2 lakhs objects both indian and foreign
22;Such a shame no one can be bothered to maintain the history;Well, given it’s so cheap at least you could argue that it’s value for money… there’s a tiny little train that goes round for about 5 minutes, you’re not allowed to look in any of the locomotives they have there, and those they do are in complete disrepair. The museum is minimal and none of the interactive features work. The diesel simulator is good fun, except for some guy coming in and repeatedly telling the children how they should be driving it properly and thus sucking all the fun out of the experience. <br>The most shocking part is the ‘exhibit’ of the royal train…pictures attached. I’ll let you make your own judgement.
22;Good place for kids;Overall good place for kids to gain knowlage. Toy train is there for fun. Neet and clean washroom. Large area for explore. Out side food allow in museum. Canteen available but food is not ok. We ordered fried rice with manchurian and paneer dosa both were below quality. Rice was uncooked, lots of oil in dosa. My suggestion keep your food with self or eat from out side
22;Noice!;You always feel like a child when visiting a Museum.<br>The museum is well kept with hundred of exhibits inside the museum building and dozens of railway coaches, engines and other rail related equipment on display.<br>You can buy tickets for toy train, joy train and a diesel engine simulator.<br>You can easily cover the museum in 3 hours.
22;On track for an interesting time.;THIS quirky site has quite a bit going on from a museum and loads of trains and rolling stock to a chance to rattle round on a little track yourself.<br>Don't make the mistake I did which was to pay for my 50 rupee (55 pence) entry ticket and walk all the way inside only to find that I needed a separate ticket for the little "Joy Train". I had to walk all the way back, get a 20 rupee ticket for that and then walk back again to the trains.<br>There are any number of locomotives and carriages to look at as well as unusual things such as special vans to carry animals such as sheep,<br>I'd happily come to the museum by tuk tuk which is so easy to do once you've calmed your nerves about going through Delhi traffic.<br>Wandering about I found the first locomotive to be built in India and station clocks made in London as well as a turntable area.<br>Inside the museum there were some incredible early black and white photographs of trains in action and a display of dozens and dozens of railway plates and badges.<br>Maps showing visitors the site, what they can see and where it is were very handy because the area to explore is a long oblong and stretches away a lot further than you'd think.<br>There is a souvenir shop which could do with a wider range of things to buy, a cafe, toilets, water points, an archive and an auditorium in what is a very well run site.<br>I happily spent a couple of hours there and would definitely recommend anyone in Delhi to pay this museum a visit.
22;A must visit for Rail Enthusiast;National Rail Musuem, New Delhi<br><br>A must visit for Rail enthusiast and for kids who want to explore the history of Railways. Located at Chanakyapuri are, besides the Embassy of Bhutan, there is ample parking space. Entry fee is Rs 50 from M-F and Rs 100 on Sat-Sun.<br>Souvenir shop was below expectations and there was hardly anything which one would like to buy. Rail Musuem covers the History of Railways from beginning to British India and present .<br>Exhibits in the premises are well maintained and informative
22;Wonderful Place for Kids;Parking place is available outside the premises. Ticket rates are high on Weekends and National Holidays.
22;Always a great place!;Due to COVID, the crowd is moderately less. It ain't so less that you feel scared being alone but neither crowded. The train rides are the charmers. <br><br>It was the second visit of my six year old (last was when he was 4). This time he had ofcourse a lot more fun and was able to put his experience into writing after coming back. He also drew engine after coming back. He was excited to see rail tracks and engines. I did not go into much teaching mode or making him learn any names of train. <br><br>While my 19 month old was just happy to run around. We took him in the pram and during the end of our visit made him walk. <br><br>Don't miss the indoor display on first floor. <br><br>Can bring own food and enjoy a relaxing picnic with family. <br><br>2.5 hrs is good enough time to spend there. One can also head to Khan market post rail museum for better dining experience.
22;Rail transport;Located in Chanakyapuri , it includes exhibits of the history of the rail of India right from British era
22;CHUK CHUK RAILGARI;National Rail museum is located at Chankayapuri in New Delhi.It is a unique museum and has collection of over 100 real size exhibits of Indian railways.The museum is spread across 11 acres of land.A toy train run around its sites.
22;The Best Rail Museum;I had to Nagpur’s Narrow Gauge Rail Museum, which is also good in its capacity. However, this one in Delhi being in National capital is the biggest. Though it has everything one should required to know, but the entry ticket is on a very higher side. Two different types of ticketing systems. On weekdays for adult it is Rs.50/- whereas on weekends and Holidays it is Rs.100/-.For child upto 10 yrs it is Rs.10/- and Rs.20/- respectively. But for one of its kind experience, don’t be regret for paying this, especially if you have child/children. Toy Train Rides(two different types) one inside the train other on top of the train to digital quizzes about railway and a vast information about the railways surely give you joy and improve your knowledge.
23;One of the oldest observatory sites;A nice observatory monument in Delhi and one of the oldest observatory sites ever created. It is relatively well maintained for the most part (although some of the older bits looked a bit more worn out) and it consists of 13 architectural observatory instruments in the site and the surrounding gardens in the area were beautiful and well maintained.
23;Unique and memorable;What a cool discovery in an unexpected place. Worth a visit and almost free (I think 300 R to enter). The park doesn’t seem to get very busy so it’s a nice place to walk around and look at all of the different pieces, relax and sit on a bench for a few minutes. <br>Unlike anything else I’ve seen!
23;Jantar Mantar Delhi is one of the Five built in India;Jantar Mantar of Delhi was built by Maharaja Jay Singh II of Jaipur way back in 1724. Maharaja Jay Singh-II had a lot of interest in astronomy and astrology,  He was good Mathematician, town planner and a very good ruler as well. He had mastered four languages: Arabic, Greek, Persian and Sanskrit. There are total 5 Jantar Mantar's in North India at Mathura, Ujjain, Varanasi, Delhi and Jaipur which were completed between 1724 to 1737. The Delhi Jantar Mantar is the one which was constructed First compare to other four of India. Second one is Varanasi, Third Mathura, Fourth Ujjain and the fifth one is Jaipur. Jaipur one was constructed at the last and in a vast area. All instruments in Jaipur Jantar Mantar are still in working condition and remaining four including Delhi are incomplete constructions and not in working condition. All these four were built for trail and but finalized in Jaipur.<br><br>The main purpose of building the observatory was to collect astronomical tables and to make accurate estimates of the motions of the planets, the Moon and the Sun. Jantar Mantar is a huge complex to learn about space and time. Jantar Mantar is actually Sanskrit work, Jantar means Machine/Instrument  and Mantra means formula/Calculation. overall meaning of Jantar Mantar is "Machine that calculate". Delhi Jantar Mantar consists of 13 architectural instruments. But among these the most noticeable ones are<br><br>Mishra Yantra which is resembling the formation of a Spade, this heart shaped structure is symbolic of Delhi. It was used to figure out noon in different cities across the world.<br><br>Samrat Yantra is the famous giant triangular sundial that raises to a height of 70 feet. It is an instrument that measures time accurately.<br><br>Jayaprakash Yantra is one of the most captivating instrument. This is actually a hollow hemisphere which reflects every point in the Sky.<br><br>Ram Yantra which measures altitude of Stars, this structure consists of two cylindrical buildings containing radial lines that spread out from a center.<br><br>Patel Chowk and Rajeev Chowk are nearest Railway stations to reach Delhi Jantar Mantar.<br>Timings:<br>Morning 06:00 to Evening 06:00<br><br>Entry Fee:<br>25 INR for Indian's and 300 INR for Foreigners.
23;Jantar mantar;Great place. A lot of scientific information. Must visit with children. The place is very relaxing with lots of trees around.
23;Great instruments of astronomy;Jantar Mantar is located in Connaught place. “Jantar Mantar” literally means “instruments for measuring the harmony of the heavens”. It consists of 13 architectural astronomy instruments. The Ram Yantra, the Samrat Yantra, the Jai Prakash Yantra and the Misra Yantra are the distinct instruments of Jantar Mantar. Entry free is 15 to 20 Rs.
23;a nice place for a stroll before most sights are open;I was up early and no where to go, so decided to stroll through the astronomical devices. The guard was helpful. I knew nothing when I arrived and learned a few things too. Enjoy!
23;Astronomy;Saw this back in December and forgot to write a review until now. These are 18th century astronomical instruments primarily for compiling the times and movements of the sun, moon and planets, and for predicting their future movements. These ones in Delhi were also built by the Rajput ruler Jai Singh II and are very similar to the Jantar Mantar in Jaipur, also built by the same dude. The difference between these and the ones in Jaipur are that these are terracotta coloured. The Jantar Mantar here is bigger but less well maintained than the ones in Jaipur. If I hadn’t already seen the ones in Jaipur, I would’ve given this a higher score. The entrance price is also quite steep if you’re a foreigner just to see astronomical instruments that no longer function.
23;Not maintained;With an entry fee of Rs.25/- for adult, this is now popular for Dharna place rather than a monument.People also come here and use this as a park. But no doubt, it also has many fine structures to see.But almost all the instruments build in cemented platform are detoriating,   lost its color and shine. But whatever remains are good and useful.
23;Indian astronomical building/s a few 100 years old;Jantar Mantar is another iconic New Delhi building that every Indian has seen a picture of in their school textbooks. It was constructed a few 100 years ago by the Maharaja of Jaipur to make accurate astronomical calculations. The main building is a sundial and it is quite accurate. The different buildings comprise of different "yantras" to calculate time, seasons, astronomical events etc. There is a lot of maths /measurementsinvolved and visiting with a knowledgeable guide would make your visit much more rewarding.Even without a guide, we enjoyed our visit.
23;Sundial;Jantar Mantar was built by Maharaja Jai singh of Jaipur in 1723. Purpose of observatory is to predict the times and  movements of the sun.<br><br>4 instruments inside the observatory are - samrat yantra, jayaprakash, Rama yantra, misra yantra.<br><br>During 1727 to 1734 Maharaja Jai Singh of jaipur had built total 5 such observatory named jantar mantar across north india, others are at - jaipur, ujjain, mathura, varanasi.
24;Found Easy Parking;I always go to Nizamuddin railway station to pick up my relatives and, every time, I get stuck in the parking area. But last time, I went to the same place a couple of days back and found a new parking service which was so quick and easy to excess the parking slot by their app named PARK+.
24;Satellite Station of Delhi;One of the main Railway Stations in Delhi, this is not very far from New Delhi Railway Station and many important trains start and terminate at this station. The station has all the major facilities and there is a large display board at the entrance (PF 1) to give you information about the trains. The station is clean and PF 1 has escalators also. Construction work is going on at some platforms so slight inconvenience while boarding and de-boarding trains on those platforms. Hope it will improve in future.
24;Nizamuddin Railway Station -Worst , Poor and High rate parking(Nizamuddin side) .;Nizamuddin Railway Station -Worst , Poor and High rate parking(Nizamuddin side) fully dark without any light. High charges 0-6 hours 100 Rs, there is no 1 hour slot as maximum people useing to dropping their relative/parents.<br>Similar situation in  Sarai Kale Khan side, Road are captured by unauthorized vendor/encroach, The real situation on Capital railway station.
24;Major station in Delhi;Nizamuddin Railway Station is one of the major railway stations of Delhi, but located in the south of the city. There’s an upper class waiting hall with several eateries on the same section. The station is pretty straightforward to navigate and is set up like most major stations in India. The facilities here are not as good the other major stations in Delhi, but I do like it because it’s well connected by metro.
24;Railway journey;It's quite well developed. If u hv been here 5 yrs before u will be amazed at the upgradation. Its become more friendly.
24;Determination and a plan;The front desk called us an Ola (India has Uber, but Ola is like the home-grown version of Uber and also widely used).  A tiny box of a car turned up with no boot/trunk so the two big bags had to go in the front passenger seat next to the bags and the two small bags and us were jammed in the back. 700 odd metres to the train station, anywhere else in the world, with wheely luggage would be nothing (OK - anywhere but Asia) but between overpasses, no footpaths, traffic, heat and sun - the $1.80 in the taxi was worth it.  Strictly speaking 85 rupees... but not one person in this nation has change, even for tiny notes. But we were prepared this time and had the front desk man at the hotel change a 100 rupee note for us (A$2) - so we only paid out 90 rupees in 10 rupee notes.  Heaven forbid we encourage a false economy and overpay at every forced ‘opportunity’ to do so.  <br><br>We got to the station and were immediately set upon by porters. But if we can pack these bags, we can carry them. Not so much we don’t want to pay the porters - we just don’t trust them as far as we can throw them as they are horrendously rough with luggage and insist on whipping out the wheeling handle at the slightest chance and endeavouring to break it off.  So lug the bags we did. Got to the right platform, found a helpful, person. She had her phone out and told us which end of the  platform to be on, 6 carriages behind the engine.  Nothering worse than being at the wrong end of a very very long train. Fortunately it was the originating station for our express to Rajasthan, so it pulled in about 9.30 am and we had plenty of time to follow it a short distance, get on our carriage and wow!<br><br>All and all a good experience, however, we find you must have plan on how you are going to negotiate the chaos.
24;Nice and clean station;Platform no. 1 of this station has lifts and escalator is also there on platform no. 1 which is on nizamuddin dargah side. Platform 6 also has an escalator.
24;Busy station need s traffic management;A number of trains start from here, but the entry point is almost always choked with vehicles. A better traffic management system is required. Also station needs lot of investment to become trendy like New Delhi Railway station, as it is one of the important railway stations of the Capital city.
24;Good place from starting journey;hazrat nizamuddin railway station is one of the biggest station in india. when i was traveling surat to leh that time i was booked my train tickets surat to hazrat nizamuddin. one of the busiest railway station in india. hazrat nizamuddin railway station is well maintained. you can easily travel any place from this station. you can start your journey from here.
24;Extremely busy railway station;Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station in Delhi is one of the main railway station serving the residents of Delhi and it's nearby areas like Noida and Ghaziabad. Named after the famous Sufi Saint Nizamuddin Auliya it is as famous as the other two stations New Delhi and Old Delhi. The station code is NZM.<br><br>It was built to take away some load from the overcrowded New Delhi railway station but it looks now that this station itself has become overcrowded. More than 50 trains originate and terminate here which makes it quite a busy station. In comparison to the other two stations, it is smaller in size but remains busy throughout the day.<br><br>There are two entry points to the station. The entry through Sarai Kale Khan is the more busy one and thus see's most of the traffic. Entry points remain jam packed being really small with hardly space for a single car to move on. Parking is a huge pain point throughout the year with taxis and autos occupying most of the space.<br><br>Facility wise there is not much in comparison to others. Though there has been some improvement in terms of passenger facilities like food stalls, train information system and general cleanliness. But a lot need to be done to give a comforting experience to the passengers.<br><br>Overall a nice station for people residing in South/East Delhi and nearby areas. Easy to reach using multiple modes of transport. Some improvement required in passenger facilities which will make it a standard railway station at par with the other two.
25;respect for the father of the nation;a simple, decent, courtyard, and the black marble marking the place where Ganhi was cremated<br>just a few trees, each one planted by former left side political personalities<br>a wonderful voice could be heard, low and discreet, fulfilling the air - those sounds, identified thanks to shazam, will accompany us during the whole trip in India<br>deep emotion
25;Great Trip Experience Of Rajghat;The garden is very beautiful and Mahatma Gandhi cremation place in Delhi. I have expected to see some information about the history of the Mahatma Gandhi . It is a place to reflect on his life and contributions of the creation of the independence of India . I particularly like the carved with some of his saying, which rings so true. It is the humbling place to visit the grounds and the monument area are simple,  peaceful and beautiful.
25;A GREAT MAN VENERATED;Raj Ghat is a memorial  to Mahatma Gandhi. Originally it was the name of a historic ghat in old Delhi<br><br>This is a calm and tranquil area dedicated to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi. It is where Gandhi was cremated following his assassination in January 1948<br><br>In the centre of the lawned and landscaped area, under an internal flame, is a black marble platform marking the site of the cremation.<br><br>Other Ghats in the same area remembered other Indian greats, Indira Gandhi (3rd Prime Minister of India, her son Rajiv Gandhi (6th Prime Minister of India (both these were assassinated) and Jawaharial Nauru (1st Prime Minister of India, and others. <br><br>Quite a moving spot and very important to Indians
25;The place where Gandhi was cremated after his assassination.;This is a memorial place dedicated to the memory of Gandhi. An eternal flame burns beside a cenotaph. There are well kept gardens in the area, and there are many flowers. The entrance is free, but there is security to pass through. Many schoolchildren visit here to help them learn about Gandhi. Definitely worth a visit, but not a place to spend a lot of time unless you wish to sit and ponder the life of Gandhi.
25;Calm, relaxing, Gandhi;The Raj Ghat is not a big fancy attraction, for instance, as the Taj Mahal. It's a quiet place of calm and humility, very symbolic of how Gandhi lived. This is where his remains are and people come to pay their respects to essentially the father of the nation. It's a large compound of grass, bush and few trees all very well-kept. It's mostly empty compared to other places you can visit in Delhi, and security is constant. As you walk to the center, there are inscriptions of Gandhi's sayings on the walls of the pavement and in the middle is the main square where the tomb is. This main zone has to be crossed barefoot (with socks) and I don't think there's shoe covers available (at least when we went there). Still, this place is very much worth the visit, specially if you want a place to relax and get away from the chaos that is Delhi.
25;A simple well maintain memorial;Though it is a large memorial, it is a very simple memorial. A wall encircles  a grassy field with a rectangular marker in the middle. You need to remove your shoes before entering and you can't carry your shoes unless in a backpack or such.
25;Calm and Peaceful;There is a black marble platform which marks the final resting place of Mahatma Gandhi and there is an eternal flame. The area is very clean and well maintained, lots of greenery around.
25;Isabelle (France);The Raj Ghat is the final resting place of the Mahatma Gandhi, who is one of the most respected Indian rulers, one of the most respected rulers of all times.<br>At the entrance of the Raj Ghat, we had to take off our shoes<br>We walked on a paved path in a peaceful garden to go to the beautiful monument of black marble, bearing the inscription "He Ram". These words mean "O my God", and have been told by the Mahatma Gandhi before his last breath.<br>Behind the monument, we saw a perpetual flame burning, which represents the eternity of the Mahatma Gandhi.<br>I highly recommend to visit the Raj Ghat!!! I found that is a haven of peace, simplicity and serenity, represents perfectly the spirit of this great peace-loving man.
25;A restful place to go;Mother and Daughter holiday Feb 2020<br>We packed a lot in to our first day in Delhi, probably too much but it would have felt wrong to have not come here. Was a short time of tranquility in and felt appropriate to feel the ground with my feet within the memorial area.
25;Mahatma Ghandi memorial;My tour group visited this memorial as part of our India tour in January 2020.  The memorial has detailed photos and stories about Ghandi's life and activism.  I also saw where Ghandi slept and where his body was laid out after his killing.
25;Memorial;located between ring road and banks of Yamuna river. simple square platform of black marble marks the spot where Gandhi was cremated
25;Mahatma Gandhi - Raghat;Rajghat is a memorial dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi in Delhi, India<br>On his birthday today -2nd Oct we remember his golden words.."Be the Change you want to See"<br>Visit the place for Tranquility and pay your respects to the beloved leader
26;Learn more</span> about animal welfare in tourism;Delhi zoo visit
26;Children enjoyed to see animals but many listed animals was not there. Snack house was totally closed. There should be water bottle shop to be there;Not for tourists
26;If you visit this place, you probably won't even get in.<br>You have to use online booking only and this only works if you have a Indian sim.<br>Staff are rude, all congregating together and very unhelpful.<br>Complete waste of journey and unfriendly for international tourists. Avoid!;Avoid this terrible experience!
26;Worst tourist spot to waste your energy. Very huge Zoo but poorly kept animals. No drinking water or food available inside! We had a 5 year old who got exhausted due to so much walking. Poor maintenance and worst management. Please avoid and save your energy and time. Free parking is available opposite the Zoo....and ticket booking instant via phone. They should have eateries inside the Zoo....we have been to Singapore and Sydney Zoo and all had excellent restaurants and food zones inside. Indian Government need to hand this Zoo over to private hands.;Excellent
26;I love the Delhi zoo. It’s my happy place. I often go to zoo alone but  one can always plan a trip with family and friend. The authorities are very strict about food that’s because  people just love feeding animals and which is not the best interests of the animals. Zoo is well kept and the credit should be given to the authorities;pathetic
26;Pathetic, there is no refreshment faculty neither inside the zoo not outside. Apart from that most of the animals were not there i.e hippo, white tiger, Bengal tiger and snakes. Some species of birds were there which was great however, not able to see them properly dur to dense cages.<br>Most important thing booking of tickets are online which is good thing but people who were illiterate, seemed struggled with the booking of tickets and they ended up with the people who were doing booking for these people by taking their bank details this leads to scams. They could be looted by these people. Govt must have a physical counter for such people. Apart from this chages of tickets per person is 80 Rs which is very high as no such animals and birds were there.<br>Overall it was very disappointing experience.<br><br>This comment was made on 21.01.2023;Mixed experience

26;When I visited this zoo in Feb -2014 with my wife, I wrote here that everyone should take their kids to this place.I was fortunate enough to be able to take my 5 year old daughter in Feb-2020.The zoo is still the same with all kids of animals. I find this as one of the  best zoos in the country. The primary attractions are the White Tiger,Bengal Tiger and African Elephant. There was Asiatic Lion too.The zoo just needs an African Lion to make it more attractive.;Worth a visit
