1;Amazing but tiring;We visited yesterday, this is a superb attraction full of historic buildings and museums. It does take sometime to get around and cam be very busy we took 4 hours to see everything and I would recommend going after lunch. To avoid the crowds. Make sure you have a good pair of walking shoes as it is all uphill will lots of stairs. I would not say that this is suitable for people with mobility issues as you cannot get everywhere due to the age of the castle.
1;Spend an afternoon at the castle!;Many surprising gems inside including the Royal crown and coronation stone, the oldest chapel in Edinburgh and plenty of spectacular views. Time your visit to see the 1 o’clock cannon go off. We spent a couple of hours and found it very worthwhile. Even the gift shop had items not found in other Royal Mile gift shops.
1;Iconic Edinburgh landmark;Had never been into the castle so felt that this was a 'must do'  attraction.<br><br>Overall it was OK, but did not have that wow factor. As one of my sons said, "It's a castle, if you have been to one then they are all the same". I tend to agree with him.<br><br>The views from the castle are great, and there are some museums to visit in the castle grounds. You can spend 2 to 3 hours here. <br><br>So some people will love it, but it just lacked a little something for us.<br><br>May be an obvious statement, but there are lots of tourists. May be a good idea to go early to miss the crowds.
1;Book before you visit.;You need to book to visit here. Very interesting place to visit, just oozing with history. Found the prison exhibition very interesting. The views from the walls are amazing, Edinburgh sure has some diverse architecture.  The castles exhibits are well lit, and text is a good size to read. Many lives are celebrated within its walls stories of heroism and sadness. Says a visit takes about two hours, think you'd need to visit at warp speed to do that! We had a good amble round, missed out on the jewels and one other display because  they close at 5.30pm and we went into the castle at 3.20pm we exited at 5.50pm the castle closes at 6pm. <br>Well worth the entry price you won't be disappointed.
1;Fascinating working castle;Spent a lovely day exploring the castle. Excellent audio tour and simply amazing views over the city. Lots to do for all the family. Would definitely recommend.
1;Beautiful historical site;Edinburgh is not only a beautiful historical site, it is an active military site. They have done a lovely job of creating interesting historical exhibits throughout the castle, including a display of the crown jewels and The Stone of Destiny (photos not permitted). There are several military memorials as well. Of course there are some shops including a great little whiskey shop. Recommend the elderberry whiskey.
1;Disappointed;We walked up to the castle which is quite a walk up there to be told we couldn’t have a ticket as you have to book on line. I said we didn’t have any internet connections with us. I was told that the tourist information shop might be able to help with a ticket after 11 o’clock but couldn’t be guaranteed. The tourist info shop was back down the hill! We were disappointed re booking on line!
1;Castle with views and hail;Great day out at the castle, cold and windy with add hail to make it feel like winter ! (Where is spring) We really enjoyed the views along with the castle it’s self. We’ll worry a visit
1;A good visit;Plan your trip in advance lest yoiu get swamped in the crowds on weekends. It is well worth a visit and has the Scottish crown jewels here.
1;Mobility Challenges were no problem;We travelled here with our 86 year old mother. The staff at the gate immediately offered a car to take us up to the top which was so kind and unexpected. This allowed mum to save her energy for touring at the top, which was spectacular, especially due to the sunny weather. A must-see in Edinburgh!!
2;Walk the halls of Royals;It is of special interest to be walking the same halls as the Royal Family does and to be viewing their official residence when visiting Scotland.<br>The audio information was informative. <br>We did not initially have this on our to do list. It was our last day and we are glad we did.
2;Beautiful architecture and very interesting audio tour;Spent a lovely afternoon walking around the Palace and Abbey. The audio tour was very informative and lunch in the cafe was delicious. Sadly the Abbey is undergoing renovation and covered in scaffolding but what we could see was beautiful
2;Admired from the outside;We arrived late in the day and admired Holyroodhouse from the outside. We knew we wouldn't have enough time to appreciate anything we saw if we bought tickets to enter. We went in the shops and through the tea room to a back garden area that my kids really enjoyed playing in.<br>We were here just days before the Queen died. So crazy!
2;Didn't Disappoint!;Enjoyed the palace and having access to so much! Nicely done in all areas including gift shop and cafe. Would go again!
2;Stunning Palace;Lovely to explore, but in reality you only need a couple of hours to go all the way around using the audio guide. The rooms are stunning and the insights by today's Royal Family provide a glimpse into how the palace is still in use today.
2;Holyrood Palace;Fabulous, thoroughly recommend the audio guides or you miss out on a lot of historical information. We spent a good half day there easily.
2;On the list of Royal residences visit;As we'd been to Windsor and Buckingham Palace, this was next. We'll worth the visit. Lovely grounds. Plenty of history and  Interesting how England and Scotland became united. There is a good cafe, clean with a good selection of drinks etc. Nice shop, expensive, but nice.
2;Royal Palace;The palace of Scottish and now British monarchy, in use for events and when the royals stay in Scotland.<br>It is at the end of the Royal mile and in beautiful park with Arthur Seat peak nearby. Parliament building is next door.<br>The palace itself is somewhat dark and in need of maintenance, but full of amazing artifacts and fascinating history throughout. Tapestries are noteworthy in particular.<br>The Royal apartments open to the public are worth seeing, but not too overwhelming.<br>The apartments of Mary, Queen of Scots’, and her husband, on the other side, are outstanding, particularly display of Mary’s jewels and the story of secretary’s murder.<br>For the history buff the great gallery would be also interesting, including the display of military ranks and honors.<br>The audio guides have very detailed tour and narration by royals, if you so prefer.<br>Unfortunately no photography, but printed guidebook is a beautiful memento.<br>We loved the ruins of the Abbey, romantic and inspirational. Definitely visit the ruins, just next to the Palace.<br>Overall a must visit in Edinburgh.
2;Relaxing and informative visit;Spent about 2 hours here. The free audio tour was wonderful!   Spent a very relaxing time enjoying the gardens and Abbey ruins. Stairs in the palace are very steep and narrow, but even with a cane I made it up. So glad I did as that was where Mary’s room was
2;Great to experience a working palace;Spent just over an hour at the palace and it was a great experience. Arrived at 10:30 and was surprised to be given an audio and interactive guide for free which is a lovely extra. Wasn’t too busy at this time of day though once inside the palace it could get crowded in rooms but wasn’t too bad. We used the family setting for the audio guide which was great for the kids as it is interactive which my daughters liked as well as the husband. Really enjoyed the history of the palace and having the opportunity to see the staterooms and learn the history. The gardens are lovely too and I am sure will look amazing in summer.<br><br>Definitely worth a visit.
3;Brilliant;Brilliant and really enjoyed it sadly this come to end of my trips so back home to Newcastle I go , I will definitely be back in the summer
3;Diversity at its best!;Wow, what an amazing place. Lots of interactive displays, some sadly not working. You can see everything here from fashion to coal mining, beetles to rockets. The displays are very diverse, a must for any family. You could spend hours here, and we did. Stopped off for a coffee in  the cafe before leaving, staff very polite and helpful.
3;This is the best museum in whole of Scotland!;This is an excellent museum, very close to the Royal Mile and full of exhibits across different topics. I loved the ones on Vikings, India and ancient Egyptians. The souvenir shop could do a bit more to add more items based on the exhibits tho. Overall, a very good visit and easily spend 3HRs here.
3;Pace yourself!;Broad and deep exhibits of Scottish history, culture, and technology. We spent almost 2 hours just with the antiquities on the lowest level. Loved the Andy Goldsworthy backdrops. He also designed the terrace garden on the roof with its fabulous views (and long waits for the lift).
3;Be ready to explore!;My disappointment was that we didn't have more time.<br>We made plans to visit the museum because of the Doctor Who exhibit that was running during the first half of 2023.  While that exhibit was incredible and we are so glad for the opportunity, we now have to make return plans to visit, just to experience the excellence on display for the rest of the museum.<br>Having limited time, we made plans to see the early period displays including Picts, Vikings and Romans.  It was good that we limited ourselves because we still felt more time was needed just in that area.  We were able to quickly see areas including the music display and middle eastern tiles as well.  <br>We are glad to have something to look forward to when we return to Edinburgh.  Would definitely recommend a day or two just exploring!
3;Absolutely outstanding;Wow, what a museum! Absolutely fantastic. Lots of interactive, colourful, modern exhibits amongst the traditional Ancient ones. The family loved it. Would highly recommend.
3;Very educational and interesting experience;Interesting and educational experience. Seeing Dolly the sheep was the highlight for me. Lots of other interesting exhibitions all the way from technology to animals. Definitely worth a visit.
3;An excellent Free museum, very hands on;An excellent museum, lots to do, very hands on for children and adults, spent a couple of hours here but ran out of time as had something else booked, for free a great half day at least.
3;A confusing mess still with depressing Covid signage.;The place is just a confusing mess. Exhibits are in a random order with no discernable logic. The actual Scottish historic collection with the iconic Lewis chessmen is in a poorly signposted side area with random placements plus awkwardly located, inadequate and badly lit descriptions.<br>It's still full of depressing Covid social distancing signage and the cafe we went to would not take cash.<br>Overall a poor advert for Scotland's notable historic heritage.
3;Something to see for everyone whatever the age! Well worth a visit!!;I took my daughter to the National Museum of Scotland to see the Doctor Who Worlds of Wonder Exhibition as she is a huge Doctor Who fan. The Exhibition itself was amazing... I didn't know what to expect but it had all the characters aswell as information not only about the characters, about Doctor Who but also about the theory of space and time travel. It had different people to listen to, interactive screens and then a cinema screen at the end which again gave information about Doctor Who. After the Doctor Who exhibition we walked around the museum to see what else was there... I can honestly say that there's something for everyone to look at! From fashion through the ages, Dolly the cloned sheep, transport through time to Ancient Civilisation and Cultures and everything inbetween! The museum itself is huge, over 5 floors. It has a restaurant and a cafe. We didn't actually get around the whole of the museum, we were there for 3 hours and stopped for a drink and piece of cake but had to move on as we had another attraction booked for the afternoon. You could honestly stay all day and look around the museum, it is that big... and that interesting! There's trails for kids to follow and ofcourse the gift shop too. It was the first time we had been to Edinburgh and we specifically came up to see the Doctor Who Exhibition but we are going to come back again so we can come back to the National Museum of Scotland, aswell as other things to see around Edinburgh. Well worth the visit and would highly recommend the museum for both adults and children!
4;A warm Scottish welcome!;On entering the building we received a very warm welcome from both the Security and Front of House staff and enjoyed a great tour of the Parliament from Carol who was very knowledgeable and friendly.  I would recommend booking a guided tour beforehand as it allowed us full access to the Parliament including the main Debating Chamber.  We also enjoyed a very reasonably priced lunch in the cafe and bought some Scottish souvenirs from the shop. Thoroughly reccomend
4;Akshay Excellent Service;Dropped down the Royal Mile to visit parliament today - not knowing it was First Ministers first QT. Went through security and we were met by Akshay who explained what was going on and if we wanted to visit the debating chamber to go up straight away....which we did and his colleagues helped us take some great photos. On exiting we came back down to reception where we were met by Akshay again who asked if we wanted to go onto the waiting list. We were amazed and took up his kind offer, we waited but unfortunately did not make it in but his honesty, help and professionalism shouldn't go unnoticed. Brilliant hour or so and we'll worth a visit....good idea to plan though 🤣🤣.
4;Love this piece of architecture;Really wanted to see this piece of architecture and wasn’t disappointed.  I loved it.  It is Strong and brilliantly engineered but the vast amount of timber in the building make it a comfortable, warm place to visit.  Sadly the architect never got to see his completed series of interconnected buildings as he died aged 45, four years before its completion.
4;Fascinating place !;We were going to go up to the top  of Arthur's Seat but the ice made it too treacherous so we popped into the parliament buildings and we were so glad that we did. <br>We were approached by an official who asked if we'd like to have tickets to go into the debating chamber. Next thing we found ourselves in the public gallery listening to the debate on the budget. It was a real drama and we were completely mesmerised! The building itself is an architectural gem. I understand that it's a bit Marmite in that people either love it or hate it - well I loved it !
4;Interesting insight;This was a really interesting place to visit and a big contrast to the British Parliament. Lovely setting and lots of facts available. Added bonus of a good gift shop.
4;Educational;Great place to visit and free to enter.<br><br>Loved being in the debating chamber as I have watched many times on TV.<br><br>Very educational visit.
4;Free, educational, and interesting;This place is definitely worth visiting. I learned so much and it's free to enter.  On non-session days, you can reserve a free tour. Our tour guide, Gordon Stewart, was very friendly, welcoming, and knowledgeable.
4;A Must for Edinburgh visitors and Scots alike;Fabulous tour,  loved the history an outstanding building.  A huge shout out to Aaron Chalmers our tour guide,  he was welcoming,  well informed and a great orator.
4;It was nice to go in the Parliament;It was nice to see where the Scotland MP’s discuss there politics. We liked the architect of the building and the outside relaxing manmade ponds   It is also good that dog walkers are allowed to let their dogs take a dip in the ponds.
4;Parliamo Politics 'Perfect' Here;XXL thanks to Gordon for a superb tour with the right mix of facts and fun . The 'Travelling the Distance' porcelain piece is the 'toothpaste wall' in Kidspeak. Brilliant.<br>    The architect's vision is a blend of the old (1670 Queensbury House) and the truly Modernistic .<br>It's a symbolic smorgasbord from walls to lights. doors to floors. A pure window wonderland as well. The swish garden lobby is press card paradise.<br>     The free tour is a must as the devil really is in the detail and the rowan tree.<br>      Loads of resources explain the work of the Parliament and the Family Trail Pack will keep kids counting saltires....forever.
5;Wander over the bridge;Parking at the car park beyond the shell garage in South Queensferry there is a viewing area (and a little coffee shop). Down the side of the public toilet is a ramp or steps to the start of the walk over the bridge. Enjoy the elevated view over the town, the forth and the Rail Bridge. Admire the love locks at the towers. And if you head all the way over pop down the steps into north Queensferry for a cafe and more bridge vistas.
5;I;I didnt know you Scott, but i can see you looking down from that bridge. I wish someone could have stopped you.
5;Absolutly Fantatsic;I have always wanted to visit the Fourth Bridge so we drove from Essex to Scotland and stayed at the nearby South Queensferry Premier Inn (see separate) review. The fourth bridge is a world heritage Unesco site and i can see why. The sheer beauty of seeing the bridge after all those years are waiting brought me to tears. Its one of the most amazing sights i have ever seen in my whole life ! And there is such a story behind the making of this 130 year old  bridge . I bought a book on the subject too. I walked up and had to feel it and when the tide was low i went down onto the shore. There is a statue in honour of men who died during construction.Whilst we stayed in Queensferry i visited the bridge everyday and i felt to sad when we had to leave for home. I took a photo and had it enlarged and put in a frame and put it on my bedroom wall so i can still look at it everyday. FANTASTIC !
5;Cafe and loos now closed.;Lovely walk, but shame the cafe and loos were closed.<br>Free car park<br>Plenty of space to park motorhome for the day.
5;Remarkable views across the Forth;Well worth the visit. You can park in South Queensferry where there are restaurants, cafes and pubs for refreshments. Free car parking but Dan be very busy and conjested.
5;Fabulous engineering;What a fantastic feet of engineering.  We were advised to see the bridge from QueensFerry, as you can see the bridge right up close.  It was fantastic to see. We went over the river on the car bridge and back just to say we had crossed the river.
5;A true Scottish Icon;This is an amazing structure and I am proud to say I worked on it during the recent refurbishment. Definitely one of a kind.
5;Classic view of three bridges;A sight to behold. We drove along and stopped at several places to get very good views of the bridges. A magnificent structure.
5;What a sight.;What a sight. Had a coffee and cake at the Manna Bakery then walked under the bridge then along the coast to Cramond, good stretchofthelegs. Then bus back to Edinburgh.<br>
5;Wonderful piece of engineering;This iconic steel structure is a UNESCO world heritage site that still functions as a railway line. Trains run across from both sides every few minutes. By today’s standards, from a purely engineering point of view, the structure is surely over designed…but has surely withstood the test of time. Definitely worth seeing together with the other two more recent suspended bridges.

7;Spectacular views of all of Edinburgh;At first look we thought this may be too much of a hike for us, but we made it to the top and found every step worthwhile. There are 2 paths, we went with the one to the right and found it very manageable. Fantastic views. We were lucky to have clear cool weather. It’s windy at the top. It’s a nice walk before or after a visit at Holyrood Palace.
7;Great views from the top;A must do if you are in Edinburgh.<br><br>A tough walk to the top. It will take about an hour and you will sweat on a hot day.<br><br>Great views from the top and a sense of achievement of reaching the top.
7;Incredible views!;Hard work getting to the top but definitely worth the effort as the views are amazing. Make sure to wear sensible walking shoes and take warm waterproof clothes if the weather is inclement
7;Amazing View;The walk to Arthur’s Seat, while not extreme, is a moderate walk that’s well worth the effort! The walk it self is fantastic and the view amazing! Hopefully you can get a fine day to do this walk as it could be challenging in the rain!
7;Picturesque View;This is a must do when in Edinburgh! It’s such a beautiful hike! Make sure to wear proper shoes and dress properly. It can be wet and windy. However, when you get to the top the view is absolutely beautiful and the views of Edinburgh and the water are picturesque.
7;Prepare before you go!;Important thing I wish I had known: there's an easy way and a hard way up the hill! But the views and the sweet-smelling gorse flowers are worth the climb. The closest restroom is at the Scottish parliament building. The park surrounding Arthur's Seat is lovely.
7;Get the best view of Edinburgh from Arthur's seat;A small hill walk to get the best view 360 views all over Edinburgh.  A little scrambling at the very top but generally a fairly easy hike to the top A great place to take a picnic on a good day !
7;Worth it!;I'm definitely not the most fit and healthy of people but if I can make it I'm sure 99% of people can too!<br>It was difficult in parts and I did have to stop several times, but the sense of accomplishment and the breathtaking views from the top are 100% worth it!
7;Beautiful;Free, stretch your legs! Views amazing, from the road bridges out to the sea. Our 8 and 11 year old loved it!!! We had the benefit of the rarely known Scottish sun………but do it!
7;A must if you come to Edinburgh!;Came on a nice sunny afternoon with the family. One side has a moderately challenging walk up, whereas otherwise is more green and calmer walk up. The top is not for the fainted hearted and needs a bit of climbing skill (not for smaller children). Would strongly recommend coming here for a good bit of exercise and taking in the breathe taking views!
8;Tough at the top;Felt slightly cheated we couldn't get up to the top level which was freely accessible recently - I know its narrow - but that was part of the promised thrill for the kids.
8;Great place, really recommend;All staff were lovely and made feel very safe on such a windy day. Very interesting facts and the interactive sections in the middle were very interesting too
8;Fabulous experience - but not all tour guides are equal;Its all change since my last visit (I think around 5 years ago). Its now guided tours only, which has its benefits as no longer do you have to squeeze past people going in the opposite direction - each tour leaves every 30 minutes (lasting 30 minutes) - we had a spectacular time, with a super tour guide (10:30am tour on Tuesday 14th Feb 2023). she provided such a great overview of  the history of the monument, things to look out for, key buildings on the Edinburgh skyline - it was really good and she was excited and passionate about her topic. If I'm brutally honest, it ended a little bit unfortunately........ as we exited the monument I showed the gentleman at the gate a photo of the outside of the monument on my phone and asked him to point out which level we had got up to - he said he was too busy as he was leading a tour (it would have taken him a second to point to it - he was clearly stressed/low blood sugar/tired etc) - his partial truth (as his tour hadn't left and was clearly bothered by having to wait for ours to exit), didn't need to be shared with me and ultimately cost his fellow tour guide the £50 we had intended to leave for the young lady that led our tour (we made a quick exit instead, feeling a little embarrassed that someone had dismissed us so quickly). It is an otherwise outstanding tour, well worth the cost £6 for a child, £8 for an adult) - but not all tour guides are equal. Views spectacular.
8;Beautiful;The beautiful Scott's Monument is visual on Princes Street with the beautiful gardens in the back ground. This gothic Monument is a focal point
8;Visit This Together With A Walk In Nearby Princess Park;The monument to the iconic famous man of the city. Done in gothic style, it is impressive and almost the first thing you see when you arrive or leave by train from Waverly.  It is also very near to Princess Park, so can be done together.
8;Closed but pretty from the ground!;An impressive building to say the least. Unfortunately, it wasn’t open for climbing when we were there. At least it was pretty to look at from the ground!
8;Interesting;Very interesting to see, and a staple when visiting Edinburgh. Doesn’t take very long, but that’s what one expects when seeing a monument.
8;Oddly large;During our visit the monument was still closed due to covid. However, this is a huge monument to Scott - bizarrely large - on Princess Street.
8;Huge!;In Poland, we have a similar but much smaller monument of this type, and it is a tombstone one.  It is located in the cemetery in the Wilanów district.  It is a monument to the Potocki family.  This one here is huge.  Symbolizes the pride of Scotland.
8;Scott Memorial;We were walking around town and came across the Scott Memorial. Very nice memorial in a very bustling part of town by the train station.
9;Amazing architecture;We visited yesterday what amazing place very spiritual. They ask for a £5 donation for its upkeep. This cathedral is not large but incredibly ornate and well worth a visit.
9;Don't miss the outside perimeter of St. Giles';We didn't enter St. Giles' Cathedral, but we did admire it from the outside. However, I write this to encourage you to explore around the Cathedral where you'll find the Victorian Statue of some Duke, The Heart of Midlothian, Old Parliament House, John Knox's grave and a statue with King Charles II riding a horse and the Mercat cross as well as a statue to Adam Smith. <br>And it's just as well we didn't take time to view the inside of St. Giles' because just days later the Queen died and we saw it broadcast on TV! Very pretty!
9;Impressive interior, free to visit;Gorgeous cathedral with very impressive stained glass windows throughout. The interior is truly spectacular and is free to visit - one not to miss.
9;Phenomenal;I wasn’t expecting to love this place so much yet it was stunning. The architecture and art in addition to the little bits of history they have for you to read make this a wonderful experience. The ceilings were honestly breathtaking. I would 100 percent recommend.
9;Stunning;Went to Edinburgh for the day and decided to have a look in the cathedral . Absolutely stunning. Beautiful stain glass windows and the ceilings are stunning. Wasn’t too busy which was good so was able to look around. Had hoped they had put something about the queen lying in state here so we could see something. Still a lovely cathedral to visit . Would recommend a visit to anyone visiting Edinburgh
9;Worth a look;This cathedral wasn’t on our „to-do-list“, to be honest we just went in because it was raining and I am glade we did! I have been in many cathedrals so far but this one is special due it’s architecture, the bright colors on the ceiling and the calm atmosphere.
9;Incredible cathedral!;Whenever I am in Edinburgh I always try to make time to visit St Giles Cathedral. It is such a beautiful building and so peaceful inside. It is free to enter however you can give a donation if you wish when there. I like to sit here and just have some moments of reflection and would recommend doing the same to anyone. I have always found the staff working to be friendly and approachable too.
9;Lovely visit to St Giles.;Beautiful building with great history. Very accessible in city centre. Free to enter and very helpful staff.
9;It's a cathedral;It's a cathedral. It's nice. Lots of beautiful stained glass windows. I probably spent 5 minutes in there as it's not my thing, but can still appreciate the beauty of it for those that might enjoy.
9;A Historical Edinburgh Landmark;This centuries’ old church is a historic architectural landmark that was recently the scene of Queen Elizabeth II’s lying-in-state in Edinburgh. Dating back from the 12th century, St. Giles is located on the Royal Mile, in between Holyrood Palace and Edinburgh Castle. Like these two important sites in the city, St. Giles has also seen its fare share of significant historical events through the centuries. Don’t miss the small Thistle Chapel which is associated with the chivalric Order of the Thistle.
10;Amazing views of the city;Fascinating monuments, in a lovely setting on top of Calton Hill. Beautiful views as you explore a lovely walk around the hilltop. Definitely worth the climb up the hill!
10;Gods waiting room?;My first visit to Edinburgh was disappointing I was met with grey skys and a boring city not alot to do.<br><br>There was open drug use in the decayed city center of Edinburgh and nothing excited me it's a average city.
10;Great views;Great views of the city. If you don’t feel confident to attempt Arthur’s seat then visit this area and walk up the steps to the top of the park and you’ll get fabulous views of the city and beyond as well as taking in the monuments: highlight being Temple of Athena which is very imposing on the landscape. Well worth an hour or more wandering here to get good photos
10;Worth the Climb!;Almost didn't bother climbing "another hill", but the views from Calton were by far my favourite from the city - more aspects to be able to look out to, from Arthur's Seat from one angle to the packed historic city, or the firth on another. <br><br>Worth the climb - wish I'd had time to sit and watch the sun set!
10;Views as good as Arthur's seat without the climb;The bus tour guide tipped us off on this one. Fantastic views of the city without having to climb Arthur's seat. Also views out to the Forth as well.
10;Nice place;Nice place with some fantastic views across the city, really nice to have somewhere to take it the city.
10;Great views;This is worth the walk. At the top there is a cute house, monuments and a museum. The views of the city are spectacular.
10;Great views;Panoramic views over Edinburgh from the city to the Firth of Forth. Nice walks. Good cafe at the observatory. An interesting place to visit.
10;Beautiful place with beautiful views, very strong and cold wind;If You want to see the whole city climb to this hill. Views are amazing! Tere are also interesting historical buildings and monuments to explore. <br><br>Beware of strong and cold wind! The day I climbed there was quite warm because of sunny weather. But up there was really really cold.<br><br>Tip: There are few options to climb up. If you need an easy access don’t choose stairs beginning from Regent Road beside Scottish Government. Instead of that choose the path between Rock House (hotel) and stairs. That path goes gentle up and down.
10;Great views of the city;From this hill you can see the Old town and the New town of Edinburgh. Also, you can enjoy the view of the rest of the city including Leith!! Great experience!! We will repeat!!
11;Brilliant;Brilliant and really enjoyed it sadly this come to end of my trips so back home to Newcastle I go , I will definitely be back in the summer
11;Diversity at its best!;Wow, what an amazing place. Lots of interactive displays, some sadly not working. You can see everything here from fashion to coal mining, beetles to rockets. The displays are very diverse, a must for any family. You could spend hours here, and we did. Stopped off for a coffee in  the cafe before leaving, staff very polite and helpful.
11;This is the best museum in whole of Scotland!;This is an excellent museum, very close to the Royal Mile and full of exhibits across different topics. I loved the ones on Vikings, India and ancient Egyptians. The souvenir shop could do a bit more to add more items based on the exhibits tho. Overall, a very good visit and easily spend 3HRs here.
11;Pace yourself!;Broad and deep exhibits of Scottish history, culture, and technology. We spent almost 2 hours just with the antiquities on the lowest level. Loved the Andy Goldsworthy backdrops. He also designed the terrace garden on the roof with its fabulous views (and long waits for the lift).
11;Be ready to explore!;My disappointment was that we didn't have more time.<br>We made plans to visit the museum because of the Doctor Who exhibit that was running during the first half of 2023.  While that exhibit was incredible and we are so glad for the opportunity, we now have to make return plans to visit, just to experience the excellence on display for the rest of the museum.<br>Having limited time, we made plans to see the early period displays including Picts, Vikings and Romans.  It was good that we limited ourselves because we still felt more time was needed just in that area.  We were able to quickly see areas including the music display and middle eastern tiles as well.  <br>We are glad to have something to look forward to when we return to Edinburgh.  Would definitely recommend a day or two just exploring!
11;Absolutely outstanding;Wow, what a museum! Absolutely fantastic. Lots of interactive, colourful, modern exhibits amongst the traditional Ancient ones. The family loved it. Would highly recommend.
11;Very educational and interesting experience;Interesting and educational experience. Seeing Dolly the sheep was the highlight for me. Lots of other interesting exhibitions all the way from technology to animals. Definitely worth a visit.
11;An excellent Free museum, very hands on;An excellent museum, lots to do, very hands on for children and adults, spent a couple of hours here but ran out of time as had something else booked, for free a great half day at least.
11;A confusing mess still with depressing Covid signage.;The place is just a confusing mess. Exhibits are in a random order with no discernable logic. The actual Scottish historic collection with the iconic Lewis chessmen is in a poorly signposted side area with random placements plus awkwardly located, inadequate and badly lit descriptions.<br>It's still full of depressing Covid social distancing signage and the cafe we went to would not take cash.<br>Overall a poor advert for Scotland's notable historic heritage.
11;Something to see for everyone whatever the age! Well worth a visit!!;I took my daughter to the National Museum of Scotland to see the Doctor Who Worlds of Wonder Exhibition as she is a huge Doctor Who fan. The Exhibition itself was amazing... I didn't know what to expect but it had all the characters aswell as information not only about the characters, about Doctor Who but also about the theory of space and time travel. It had different people to listen to, interactive screens and then a cinema screen at the end which again gave information about Doctor Who. After the Doctor Who exhibition we walked around the museum to see what else was there... I can honestly say that there's something for everyone to look at! From fashion through the ages, Dolly the cloned sheep, transport through time to Ancient Civilisation and Cultures and everything inbetween! The museum itself is huge, over 5 floors. It has a restaurant and a cafe. We didn't actually get around the whole of the museum, we were there for 3 hours and stopped for a drink and piece of cake but had to move on as we had another attraction booked for the afternoon. You could honestly stay all day and look around the museum, it is that big... and that interesting! There's trails for kids to follow and ofcourse the gift shop too. It was the first time we had been to Edinburgh and we specifically came up to see the Doctor Who Exhibition but we are going to come back again so we can come back to the National Museum of Scotland, aswell as other things to see around Edinburgh. Well worth the visit and would highly recommend the museum for both adults and children!
12;Spacious venue;We had seats in the circle for an afternoon concert - we were round the side in the second row. The external door for the circle is to the left of the main entrance, but clearly marked and we found it easily. The view of the stage was good but the sound quality wasn't great from there. I'll try a more central seat if I go again. There's not a lot of space to wait outside the auditorium, although the doors opened an hour before the show.<br>There seemed to be plenty of toilets and no queue.<br>The show we saw (Lord of the Rings Music) had a lot of technical issues which won't be the Hall's fault. I was however amused to hear Christmas music playing during the interval....in April
12;Customer Care Terrible;Received an email stating doors open at 18:30. We arrived at 18:30 and were met by around 100 people who were trying to get shelter from the torrential rain. It’s not acceptable making people wait in that weather for 12 minutes until you’re ready to open the doors. (No apologies were given) We then made our way to the bar at the left side of the stalls to buy a drink. No seats in the bar area and we’re told we can’t gain access to our seats until 19:00. (Why) The stench from the toilet at the bar area was overpowering which is where we were told to stand until our seats were ready.<br>Luckily the concert was superb as the Usher Hall is a great venue.<br><br>Customers would be a lot happier if the venue is ready to accept customers when they are told the doors open.
12;Fun Police on Duty - bad form Usher Hall;Went to see Belinda Carlisle, supported by The Christians. <br>I stood up to dance remaining at my designated seat, as many others were doing around the hall!!! An attendant mentioned I may need to sit down or be moved to another area if anyone complained, found this very inappropriate as there was only 1x row behind my hubbie and I. This really changed my enjoyment and put me in a back foot thinking I could be removed for dancing 💃 as most in the Hall were. Felt I had been single out wrongly and inappropriately - 1st time to Usher Hall, may be my last!<br>We had travelled up for the weekend, staying 2 nights to enjoy Edinburgh and the concert. The attendants handling of my time at Usher Hall will influence my desire to return and spend money north of the border!
12;One of the best Scottish concert venues!;I absolutely love the Usher Hall in Edinburgh and find the building to be very beautiful and dazzling. The staff who work at the concerts are always so friendly and helpful if you have any questions or aren't sure where to go. The view from any area of the venue can't be faulted and I always find the fact the floor raises the further back you get always helps to ensure your view isn't obstructed even if standing near the mixing desk etc. The sound quality is crystal clear and artists of live music who are performing there always comment on how lovely the venue is. 10/10 would recommend for live music!
12;Beautiful architecture inside and out;Usher Hall is a wonderful old place in the heart of Edinburgh. It is a traditional concert hall. Great venue for concerts. Excellent visibility of every place in the hall, good acoustics and good location.
12;Great venue small seats;Great venue, went to see the aussie pink floyd show. We were in the very back row in the upper circle so the lighting an strobe lighting was marvellous but beware of the upper circle, the steps are very high and steep and if ya not happy with heights it's difficult to move around like the lady at the side of me found out. Seats are small as per theatre type venues.
12;Beautiful building;Went to the Firebird concert and thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience from the fabulous music and the ambience of the Hall. Would love to go back again.
12;loved the theatre,not the security;usher hall first time there to see tony hadley,great theatre,sound,and the concert was great,but the staff ,security was dreadful.pushing people about,woman as well,because they were dancing!!! they paid for a good time and they stopped it,thought there was going to be a fight as a husband got annoyed rightly for them thugs!! manhandled his wife shocking,need to change this now
12;Mixed feelings;Firstly Rumours of Fleetwood Mac were incredible so we had an amazing night! But as for the venue, the bar prices are ridiculous and the staff are OTT. Some may say rude. Not sure if I'd choose to watch my favourite artists here again.
12;Ridiculous;Security staff would not allow me to enter the gig because “I looked like I sell drugs”… I was more than<br>Happy for the staff to search me but purely based on my appearance to the door staff I was not aloud in.. £46 for a ticket to be denied entry by looks. Ridiculous
12;Awful;Went to see James Morrison was really looking forward to this but was a major let down due to the venue. Bar prices were extortionate. No area for standing was all seated. People seated near us were asked to leave for dancing! Was ridiculous won’t ever be back to a concert at the Usher Hall would not recommend.
12;Excellent performance by the Stereophonics, but the venue needs to up its game for its customers.;On a gig night to wait 45 minutes for a drink at the bar, even taking into account Covid is rubbish. Everyone had to show covid pass which is fine, but once inside very few people wearing masks and no enforcement. Good acoustics in the venue for a gig though.
13;RUDE people;We went to our first play here in the UK. The play was amazing. Great actors. BUT some of the crowd was SO rude we just about left. We are not from here. If you don’t want guests eating during the play, why sell snacks to them. Overpriced snacks??? This was an extremely humiliating experience and has left my idea of a friendly UK very skewed. A lady told me to shut up and I did put the snacks down, I didn’t know I wasn’t allowed to eat! Her and her friends continued to point at me through the ENTIRE show even though I continued to look straight ahead at the show. Then the lady working said, yes you’re not suppose to eat during the show. Since this city is a huge tourist place, perhaps let your guests know what is customary! I certainly wasn’t eating like a pig. Will NEVER go to another play in UK again.
13;Great theatre like olden days;Attended the theatre to see Buddy Holly Show, it’s an old fashioned theatre with really comfy spacious seats, show was amazing. Really lovely theatre
13;Here For the Neighbours Tour;First time at this theatre at it didn't disappoint. Modern and bright from the outside, beautiful and traditional in the inside. All the staff we met were helpful and polite.<br>Thoroughly enjoyed our show (incl meet and greet). Would love to return again.
13;Hey Duggie!!!;We were here as a family for Hey Duggie Live. The theatre is in a great location with a good bus service and walking distance from Waverley Station. Easy access (with lift that those who needs them). We were near the front and had a great view of the stage. The seat were comfortable and reassuringly old fashioned so it felt like going to the theatre in my youth!  A great venue.
13;Fascinating theatre tour;Excellent theatre tour. Great stories and enthusiasm from Graeme the guide, brought the history of the theatre to life. Fascinating to see the stage/back stage with the panto sets in place. Highly recommended.
13;Snow white panto;Absolutely amazing Snow white panto .Alan Stewart grant stot and them all were amazing .so funny .Great end to my Christmas break
13;Improve musical.;Don't go. It was embarrassingly bad. The cast was made up of a bunch of students who thought they were funny. Not in the least!! We walked out before the end.
13;Amazing customer service;Fabulous customer service was given yesterday for the ‘older’ generation when the visited the theatre. <br>We reserved accessible parking, the seats that were suggested by the box office were perfect  and the inside staff made it easy access to the parking after the show. <br><br>Well done very attentive and respectful staff
13;A TRULY WONDERFUL SHOW;Visited the theatre last night  to see Anything Goes, what a terrific show with a great, band, excellent singers a most amazing  set and a very appreciate audience
13;Singing in the Rain.;We came here to see the musical "Singing in the Rain" and it was absolutely fantastic as the show version of the iconic film was not only beautifully staged but the singing and dancing was outstanding.  The theatre itself is absolutely superb
13;Very spacious for a theatre;I visited with family to see Singing in the Rain, which was an amazing show. I hadn't visited that theatre before and was pleasantly shocked at the space inside. Moving in and out of the stalls was easy, even with people seated, the bar area was a great size and larger sized bathrooms meant queues went down very quickly.
13;Everybody's talking about Jamie;Really good musical great songs and story the lead person that played Jamie was exceptional  a great night out
14;Heart of Midlothian POTY;What a fantastic evening from start to finish!<br><br>Champagne flowed at the champagne reception. Wine and beers were continuously being topped up on tables. All staff were so pleasant. The food was really incredible for such a big function.<br><br>Absolutely brilliant.
14;Bar team get selective;Here to see Russell Brand and as we just get to the bar, their machine ran out of paper. Minutes ticked by and they couldn’t fix it. Then notice came that the bar had to close… as we walked away the same staff served two guys. When questioned their response was the Russell Brand staff said they could serve them. What a way to start a night out… let’s hope there’s no ‘equal opportunities’ political satire in the show!
14;DistantPod Live;Attended to see the Socially Distant Sports Bar live show and the venue was great, bar staff were incredibly efficient and it was only five minutes from Haymarket.
14;Trip;Outstanding venue! Amazing customer service I highly recommend this place to family and friends! Will not disappoint
14;DDL 2019 - Great Venue;Attended the EICC last week for the DDL conference.<br><br>Staff at the venue are great and it’s easy to access.<br><br>Food and drink are very good considering it’s a conference facility and they are catering for 800+ people<br><br>Spotlessly clean and well maintained<br><br>All in all great place and the conference was successful.
14;Legendary BBC Radio 4 Dead Ringers show in Edinburgh;The Edinburgh International Conference Centre (EICC) is a vast place, where the fringe festival put on the legendary BBC Radio 4 comedian series show Dead Ringers (photo attached). <br>It featured the dream team of Jon Culshaw, Jan Ravens, Lewis MacLeod and Duncan Wisbey.<br><br>The seats were comfy and spacious, and the show was located on the upper floor of an all-seated room which sat around 600 people. <br><br>The comedians performed one hour of polished routines involving political and topical humour for which Dead Ringers has won critical acclaim over its nearly 20-year history. <br><br>So, if you get a chance to see them, then you will witness one hour of brilliance from start to finish, and you will leave the (EICC) talking about it for a few hours.
14;Huge center;I am here for a TED conference and this is our main venue. The place is huge, with so many levels. The main auditorium is massive with amazing acoustic.
14;Great space but manage expectations;The EOCC has some great space for conventions and conferences. The staff are helpful as well. However, it can be complicated to find some areas and easily maneuver between floors.
14;Confusing;Confusing convention center with too many small levels up or down in the basement, stairways go up or down by two floors at a time, if you need to go up or down by only one you shall take the other staiway at the other end of the floor. Confusing.
14;Edinburgh International Conference Center;The conference center is huge and the staff are incredibly professional.  We had a group of over 1200 and our every need was met.  I was thoroughly impressed.  Well done!
15;Nice contemporary art;The building is interesting, and the art is worth looking at.  It amazes me that the museum doesn't charge an entrance fee but it's nice for those who may not otherwise be able to see the art.
15;A lovely building.;This is a lovely and central building, and we were supposed to visit the gallery, but were surprised to find it close when we arrived.
15;Imposing building;We visited the Royal Scottish Academy in March, just before lockdown.  It faces directly on to Princes Street and is quite an imposing building with huge pillars.  We did not find much here to interest us as we did not want to pay an entrance fee for the main exhibition.  We much preferred the Scottish National Gallery which is the building just behind the RSA.
15;A Georgian gallery of art;Nice modern and contemporary art exhibition. Spectacular architecture of the Greek-style building. Beautiful historical pieces.
15;A great classical building with a varied programme of art exhibitions;The building, built by the architect William Henry Playfair in 1822-6 and extended in 1831-6 for the Board of Manufactures and Fisheries, is one of those classical buildings which contributed to the reputation of Edinburgh as the 'Athens of the North'.  The Academy supports contemporary arts in Scotland and today the buiding is connected into the National Galleries of Scotland Building at the rear which gives it flexibilty in the way that it shows exhibitions <br><br>I visited in late February when the Academy was housing the 2020 edition of 'New Contemporaries' -  showing a selection of the best new talent in Scotland from the  2019 degree shows at universities and art schools in a wide range of media including painting, sculpture, film-making, photography, printmaking, installation, performance and architecture.  The art was varied - reflecting the world outside - with some comfortable, some challenging.  For me, the architectural projects - rooted in reality - were the best.

16;Excellent collection - not too large, not too small;Small focused collection with some outstanding examples of Scottish painting of multiple eras. Currently undergoing expansion to improve accessibility and allow for display of more items.
16;Great range of pictures;We had a spare morning in Edinburgh before a family occasion and this gallery is free to visit. It has a wide collection of old masters and French impressionists among others. They also had an excellent range of specifically Scottish painters and subjects and it is a chance to see very famous works such as The Monarch of the Glen and The Skating Minister. The gallery has a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. It was an excellent choice and made for a fully enjoyed morning.
16;Relaxing;Loved walking around and observing some gorgeous artwork. It's not too long it's tedious but not too short you feel unsatisfied, I'm sure as the new work on the building finishes there'll be more to view for art fanatics. Loved to see Van Gogh and Monet, truly star struck seeing their work for the first time. It's not insanely busy, so still pleasant to view despite being in the centre of Edinburgh. Only problem is if you have luggage there's minimal lockers to store it in and you cannot take it with you into the gallery, so it's an activity for when you've settled into your hotel or accommodation. The cafe is also gorgeous and has incredible scones and lattes!
16;Free art for everyone!;Fantastic Gallery, free entry.  Public transport right outside. <br><br>Lovely tea room in gallery adjoining. Also lockers for cases / bags. <br><br>Not exhaustingly huge but just right and with a fabulous collection. <br><br>Delighted to see a Van Gogh. <br><br>
16;Free visit definitely worth it;This is a reasonable and not overwhelming collection, obviously with a lot of Scottish painters, but representing many of the grand masters, even if with just one work or two. The permanent collection is free.
16;What’s better than a free gallery on a wet Sunday;The Gallery is really well maintained and perfectly set out. Some of the guards will engage too and we’re very friendly. <br><br>I particularly like a bench or two to sit and appreciate some of the larger pieces and they really do have some nice pieces. <br><br>It’s a great deal to have a free gallery such as this although we did make a financial contribution. As an added bonus the restaurant on the ground floor is fabulous.
16;Saturday Lunch in Edinburgh / Great Impression;Fantastic Scottish food and great service from Chloe as well. Lovely ambience and spacious seating with beautiful views.
16;Not my cup of tea. Others might enjoy it.;Took refuge from the rain in here. Some nice paintings but nothing that stood out for me. Classic art is not really my cup of tea.
16;Excellent Gallery with Wonderful, Friendly, Helpful Staff;The Scottish National Gallery is located between New Town and Old Town, so the odds are good that you'll pass it often during a visit. The collection is fairly large and admission is free for most of it. When we visited, there was an impressionist exhibit and there was a charge for admission, but it was well worth it. We visited on a weekday and it was not crowded. There is a small gift shop, and I believe there is a cafe (but we did not visit it).
16;Quiet respite;There are wonderful pieces of art at the gallery.  It was laid out to have a clean view of the works.  It was fairly busy but easy to see what you want to see
17;My first visit to Parliament House, and Scotland;This was my first time in Scotland. I am a Professor of History and Fulbright Scholar at a college in Chicago. I definitely enjoyed my visit to the Parliament House today in Edinburgh. The staff were exceptional, and very wecoming, and I hope to return tomorrow to see members of Parliament in session.
17;Justice' Perfect;Behind St Giles , dark, discrete, number 11 door leads you into Scotland's oldest Parliament (circa 1630). Since the Act of Union it has been used by the Court of Session. Public Courts are open to all, so weekdays from 9am ,you can pass security and visit the Great Hall. The stunning roof and stained glass are matched by sculpture and paintings (even a Raeburn) of famous legal figures to present day.<br>     Superb corner info table includes detail about the 2014 restoration and upgrade of  facilities throughout the whole court.<br>    Welcoming staff and a few friendly bewigged and suited  legal eagles in the corridors . <br>    Restaurant downstairs .<br>Combine this with a tour of the new Holyrood Parliament and you've made your own wee bit of history.
17;A rather ugly looking building.;This is a rather ugly building, located just behind St. Gile's cathedral.<br>Its walls have seen better days and it needs some major TLC, as soon as possible.
17;Magnificent Buildings;Prior to the union of Scottish and English parliaments this was where the Scottish parliament met. These magnificent buildings are on the Royal Mile and easily located if you are on this route.<br><br>The architecture is very impressive and worth checking out on your walk up the Mile.
17;Parliament Square;Parliament Square is an extremely beautiful and architectural part of Edinburgh, containing Parliament House and many other old buildings.<br><br>This is a place in Edinburgh which should not be missed. Although I couldn't because of Covid, I recommend getting a tour of the building.
17;Old Parliament;Just behind St Giles church is the original parliament building of Scotland.<br>Alot more impressive than that new monstrosity they now sit in.<br>It is free to enter but a lot of the building is out of bounds. Worthy of a quick visit.
17;Imposing buildings of the Parliament House;I could not agree more with the previous reviewer: the beautiful buildings of the Old Parliament House are in striking contrast with the ultimate ugliness of the New Parliament of Scotland near the Holyroodhouse. <br><br>The harmonious ensemble of the Parliament Square includes the Mercat Cross, St.Giles Cathedral, the statue of 5th Duke of Buccleuch outside of St Giles Cathedral, the equestrian statue of Charles II... all of them make the Old Town unforgettable. We enjoyed it on a very rainy and windy day... luckily, the weather failed to spoil the impression.
17;Original Scottish Parliament buildings;Very impressive buildings in the old part of town. Makes me wonder why the new ugly site of the Scottish parliament buildings near Holyrood palace were ever thought about!! Magnificent buildings and others too in Parliament Sq
17;Behind the scenes;Visited with a group of friends as part of Doors Open Day and got to go behind the scenes in the Supreme Court to see parts that the public don't normally get to see. A 45 minute long tour which was very interesting and informative.
17;Interesting tho'embarrassingly amateurish.;Visited here as part of the Open Day festival. Stunning Hall greeted us. Option of tour or witness an re-enactment of a trial. Encouraged by effervescent organisers to go with former. Amiable tour guide regaled some interesting folklore as she took us through the labyrinth of chambers/cells beneath ground level. Losing her way several times and reading from a script suggested inexperience and unprofessionalism.<br>Okay this was free, but as abassadors of Scottish history/politics, this was a embarrassing as an Edinburgh citizen.
18;Clean, green and so beautiful;We walked through the gardens upon arrival in this beautiful city and it's great to have such a beautiful park right in the middle of the city centre. It's clean, quiet and a nice place to hang out. Beautiful views of the lit castle in the night.
18;Gorgeous Spring Flowers;Nice afternoon springtime stroll.  I usually don't stop to look at statues, but there are some interesting ones here--well worth noting.  The spring bulbs are fantastic.
18;Playground;Traveling with kids? You always need a playground in your back pocket. Thank goodness Princes Street Gardens has a great one and they're in a most picturesque spot at the base of Edinburgh Castle. After a day at the castle and walking the entire Royal Mile and back, we ended our time in Edinburgh here...playing as the sun sank into evening.
18;Beautiful gardens;We were so lucky to have brilliant sunshine when we visited Edinburgh! The gardens in Princes Street were full of spring flowers which looked stunning in the sunshine! And the views up to the castle are amazing!
18;Beautiful;Gorgeous and super clean! Would be perfect for a picnic or a meet up with family/friends. Lots to see and plenty of places to sit and relax.
18;Relaxing Walk;Exploring these gardens on foot is one of the delights of Edinburgh. Perched underneath Edinburgh castle, there is a lot to see from the themed displays, monuments and water features. The grounds are well maintained and it is easy walking. It is a great place to relax.
18;Lovely Walk;The gardens are a lovely place to stroll through. There are many places to sit and enjoy the scenery and the well-maintained plants are lush and green.  There are many statues, each with a placard containing the story of the subject. Don't miss the fountain!
18;A nice walk;I was with my partner in Edinburgh for a couple days to celebrate his birthday in October 2021. When exploring the city we decided to walk around these gardens. It is lovely to walk around see a few different things along the way.
18;Fantastic;We really loved coming here! The atmosphere, the views, the fact it’s in the city and it’s not loud, you can hear the birds, other animals and it’s so dog friendly!! My dog was off leash and was so good, other dogs off lead were also really good! It was just wonderful. It was clean and well maintained!! Lots of benches to sit and a nice cafe!! So many trees and grassy areas hopefully next time the fountain will be on!
18;Backdrop of the Castle;Part of my childhood with the setting in front of the Castle. The shops on Princes Street sadly not what they were and some of the food outlets in the Gardens not what they used to be but there are so many positives from the picnic areas to the fountains.
19;Beautifully Appointed Hotel;Beautifully appointed large super high ceiling room. Very spacious with great king sized bed and soft silky sheets. Marbled Bathroom spacious and clean. Staff super friendly and very welcoming. Hotel in great location to explore Edinburgh. Highly recommend. Had Afternoon Tea that was very tasty, especially the scones and pastries. Lots of good eats within the hotel. Has two wonderful restaurants to chose from.
19;Elegance, Comfort and Charm;We stayed 3 nights at The Balmoral prior to a trip on the Royal Scotsman train (see separate review) and (an additional night after our train trip). Having arranged for airport pickup through the hotel, we were most pleased that our room was ready upon arrival before noon after an overnight flight. However, the assigned room was not to our liking so we were offered another option. That is, a paid upgrade to the Bowes Lyon Suite, which we accepted. It made for a most comfortable 3 night stay with an excellent impression of The Balmoral’s check in service by Bernadette. Most striking is the consistency of service throughout hotel including housekeeping, concierge, bellman, hotel bar and restaurant. Everyone seemed committed to providing a high level of service with a personal twist with one exception. We very much enjoyed our conversations with Pierre in the restaurant and the harpist playing at afternoon tea.
19;Love this hotel but hate leaving!;The one exception to our visit was an exchange with the Princes Restaurant hostess on a Friday evening, April 21. She was most unhelpful (and unfriendly) when we requested a table that we had sat at two previous nights. She refused to seat us at this table stating it was for 3 persons, not two. It was very early in the evening and only one other couple was dining in the entire restaurant. This same hostess was also present at breakfast the next morning. Although we did not encounter her that morning, we did observe her unpleasant and unfriendly interactions with other customers. I call attention to this because it seems to be such an outlier from every single other person we met and interfaced with during our stay at The Balmoral.
19;Great;The ambience, upkeep, cleanliness and historical features of the hotel added to a memorable and pleasant experience. We would definitely stay here again should we return to beautiful Edinburgh.
19;Iconic hotel, but has kinks that needs to be addressed;Stayed here for my husbands 60th birthday. Spent weeks planning a balloon display and cake for our room. Every email was sent timeously and they never made me feel a nuisance.
19;Amazing customer care to local Edinburgh residents;We took them up on the offer of being met at the train station with a porter. The guy was friendly, efficient and helpful. In-fact, everyone we met with were so friendly, efficient and helpful. The room was quiet, cozy and clean.
19;Surprise 60th Birthday;Ate breakfast here one morning - everything was tasty, staff great. Had drinks in the bar too and thank you for my complementary dessert. Nice surprise and totally unexpected.
19;Wish I could give 10 stars🌟🌟🌟;This was our 2nd visit and yes we will save up and come back. Love the hotel but hate leaving!
19;Superb stay;we went for a birthday and had a fantastic time, from arrival, check in and drinks were first class with first class service. We ate in the restaurant which was fantastic. It cost a small fortune but worth every penny!
19;Great bar;This is truly an iconic hotel, standing out in the Edinburgh skyline.
20;A touch of paradise in the middle of the city;We walked to the Royal Botanical Garden on the second day of our visit.  Located on the north side of the city it is 70 acres of paradise right in the middle of Edinburgh.   They are one of the most renowned gardens in Europe and have been able to bring to life an amazing array of flowers and trees and plants that one would ever get to experience anywhere else.  Peaceful and tranquil is exactly how I would describe this place.  It is a place to just come and be.   It is free to the public and I highly recommend it to everyone especially if you are a plant and flower enthusiast.     Have a great visit.
20;Really Nice Walk;We stopped here via one of the hop on hop off buses. <br><br>I'm not a massive gardener but I really enjoyed walking round here, lots to see and really nice quiet peaceful walk.<br><br>A nice place to just wander round for a couple of hours.
20;Spectacular and peaceful gardens;Although it was 46 degrees the gardens were lush and beautiful and the staff were warm and friendly. We had a late lunch in the cafe that had a plethora of delicious offerings. The cafe is surrounded by windows so the view is spectacular.
20;Edinburgh Botanic busman's holiday;We had such wonderful weather.  A sunny day to explore the glorious spring colours.  Spent a full morning .  It did not disappoint.  So well maintained.  You know  these people love their jobs.  Couldn't fault any of it.  Well done.  Very busy  (bank holiday) so the cafe was chocker but it didn't matter to us.
20;A lovely day out;One of our first stops in Edinburgh was the botanical gardens. Despite the ever changing weather, we had a lovely time. The exhibition ‘Shipping Roots’ by Keg De Souza was really interesting and a great mix for those who love plants and art. After a wander around the gardens, we were a bit disappointed that the glass houses were closed but this couldn’t be helped. Particular highlights include the many waterfalls and the sculptures throughout.
20;Worth a visit and it's free!;Definitely worth a visit as it is free! We really enjoyed walking around the gardens and on street parking is available close by. My advice would be to take lots of change if driving in Edinburgh as not many of the machines take card. We were lucky to find a spot on the street with a machine that takes card payment. The cafe is really lovely and they use produce they've grown in the gardens. The glasshouse was shut for refurb so hopefully next time we visit we will be able to see it. The staff in the cafe were very friendly and the cafe was very clean and well looked after.
20;Well worth a visit, but needs a lot more work;Loving nature, we enjoyed the wealth of information and tours. The greenhouses need attention but we’re worth visiting. The grounds were well set out and the walls were wonderful.<br><br>You can see the work that they are trying to do, and I work recommend this as a peaceful and enjoyable afternoon, especially in autumn
20;Christmas at the Botanics was very beautiful;I have to admit I’m not very big fan of Christmas or Christmas songs. But I wanted to see that path at botanics because so many people talked about it.<br><br>The whole path was so beautiful! And there was also other music than just classic Christmas songs so I survived and loved it. :D<br><br>I definitely recommend this for everyone. No matter do you like Christmas or not.
20;Christmas at the Botanics is truly an experience!;We managed to book a visit to the gardens to see the Christmas lights and it was a fantastic and magical experience. It’s quite a long walk, so be prepared to spend at least an hour there, but you also get plenty of food trucks and toilets along the tour. We got in from the east gate and it’s quite a good way to start the visit. The gardens are stunning by day as well of course!
20;Good, but DO NOT waste your money on the insurance that is offered.;Christmas at the Botanics was much better than I thought it would be and our grandchildren were enthralled by many of the installations. The only bit that I would agree is "naff" was the very final "snowflake" display - made worse by the choice of music. My only complaint was the extra we paid for insurance. Two of our party developed COVID and were too ill to come. As they were visiting from England it is totally impossible for them to meet the criteria for proof from a GP demanded by the small print of the insurance. Fell badly stung by that.
21;;One of the most beautiful corners of Leith. Not to be missed.
21;;It's a lovely building to work in
21;;Somewhat let down by Transport Scotland's misgovernment of the completion of Queensferry Crossing which needs retrofitting of a solution to prevent ice falling from the cables onto the carriageway risking damaging vehicles, requiring the bridge to be closed rarely in winter. Misgovernment includes :- 1) withholding technical information about the engineering specifications for no good reason 2) failing to commission ICE-buster Peter Dow to solve the problem of ice falling onto the carriageway 3) ruling out a heated cable technology solution before  roperly testing the concept Search Electrically de-icing the Queensferry Crossing cable-stayed bridge.
21;;This is an amazing place to just come hang out and have some food and a walk about reminds me of the waterfront in Cape Town
21;;Nice wee seat of government power
21;;Amazing  home of SCOTTISH Government
21;;Great
21;;A colonial HQ , unwelcome in Scotland.
21;;Lovely place
21;;Unable to contact
22;Clean Comfortable base;We are musicians who travelled to Bute yesterday to play a gig and needed somewhere that was clean and comfortable after a long day. Bute House Hotel was just the thing. Came in from the cold to warm comfortable rooms. Great price and great communication meant that it all went like clock work. Many thanks. Paul and Laura.
22;A cheap overnight option- dog friendly;This is a difficult review. We really liked the couple who are managing the hotel and the room had a lovely view of the harbour and is very close to the ferry. The building itself is very dilapidated and old. On entering it smells musty. The rooms are only just adequate for today’s modern demands, but it seems other properties in Rothesay itself are similar. Do put a mirror on the wall somewhere so you can see to do your hair and make up Steph, the temporary manager, was delightful and helpful but hotels need permanent management to keep up the standards The hotel was great for dogs and we had 4 greyhounds and a shih tzu at breakfast Overall if you know what to expect, for what we paid, it was ok for an overnight stay Bute is beautiful and worth a visit and the stately home ‘mount Stuart’ is amazing
22;It does what it says on the tin;me and my daughter stayed for a short 'family business' visit - booked almost last minute. Well, I was never expecting bells and whistles, but our accommodation was perfect for our needs and very reasonably priced. Initially our requested needs fell short but this was down to the booking company, and the staff upgraded us straight away, at no additional expense. The staff were so helpful and happy - something you don't get in many places! I can't speak for the breakfasts as time constraints meant we weren't in a position to appreciate them. The location is brilliant - a minute from the ferry. Our room, although not luxurious was clean, functional and very spacial. This hotel would be fantastic for families needing space, and for explorers seeking a nice warm comfortable bed after a hard days trekking!! Wouldn't hesitate to go back or to recommend. My thanks to all there who welcomed us xx
22;5stars great cosy just had new owners last few months so still upgrading in parts we spent just under £100 for 4people;"Hi booked direct through the hotel. direct with sally it was for short notice. sally asked what we needed and did everything for us 3adults and 1child. we were booked great as my mum is 77 years old and could stop er worrying. we arrived pressed the front bell and was warmly greeted by sally and her team we were told we were getting upgraded to 2rooms room 4and 5 fantastic. room 4) 2beds great view and storage and kettle etc own bathroom yes bath and shower and sink toilet towels and shower stuff shampoo and body wash. room 5) great view 3beds TV table and chairs to eat at great storage kettle and sugar milk etc own shower room with sink and toilet I thought its hot in here yes it was warm and cosy I left the windows open came back later. well we had our keys to come and go as we wanted it was great very clean comfortable and we were asked on a few occasions if we were all right. if we needed anything just to ask. this was a Saturday night. so there is things going on as your on the corner of Guilford square shops• local pub etc• but after 11.30 I didn't hear any noise had a great night sleep woke up to breakfast this may cost more but we paid for it at the time of booking the room. Full continental breakfast and also full fry up toast tea coffeee. offered to leave our bags and pick them up later. so we could look about maybe go on a boat or grab an ice cream I felt like a king from booking with sally on the 12th may for stay sat 15th to sun the 16th and it didn't let me down views to kill for sitting with a coffee looking out the window thankyou Bute House hotel and to sally and all the team hope to see you soon the watt squad ❤️ x"
22;Not the best;I stayed here for work, when we got the the "hotel" we were met by a sign to call a number. After calling it 3 times to no answer a local asked if we were checking in, he said the receptionist was in the pub across the street, I went in and she was full of the bevie, showed us our rooms in a drunk manor. No breakfast was on offer or even offered. The room was dark and very dated. The hallway and entrance had a musky smell. The bathroom was ok but the shower was cold. On the plus side the bed was nice and soft but the sheets were not the best ( very used ) one of the most unprofessional hosts I have come across. If my company hadn't already paid for the room I would of slept in my car and kept the money. Won't be back in a hurry . Good points. It's right in the centre of town and the bizkits in the room were good. If you like bizkits this is the place for you.
22;Worse Hotel Stay Ever;Stayed at this hotel earlier this month for a family event. After reading many reviews I was expecting quite good service and decent hotel however the entire opposite occurred. I have listed the components of this hotel which made my stay the first and last ever.  Rude owner: the owner made me and my other members of family very uncomfortable and angry at the attitude we received.  Bed Linen dirty and torn.  No hot water in the shower despite leaving it on for a while to see if it would heat up. Heating in the hotel is not provided 24hrs, only 5.5 hours. Paying for a hotel you would expect heating to be provided but yet was freezing the entire stay. And even when heating is on, it was the lowest setting possible. Owner is not present for arrivals and departures. You have to call the owner to let him know you have arrived and also to figure how you check out. I view that as unprofessional as business hours are technically 8am to 6pm (general view). Overall, the hotel experience was horrendous. Never will stay here again. Checked out as soon as I could the next day!
22;Bluebird visit;The owner was most helpful in accommodating us at short notice while visiting the Isle of Bute to see Bluebird arrive. Our room was OK, in particular, the view was excellent. I understand the hotel is undergoing refurbishment and is a work in progress. Highly satisfactory for what we wanted. We will certainly visit again
22;Weekend visit;There is no parking at hotel. Owner very nice and trys to be helpful The room we had was very small and nowhere to sit other than on bed. Bathroom had a maserator fitted and it was very noisy when in shower etc The room had no tv, we queried this and was told this room had no tv but we could move to another room if we paid the housekeeping fee, although we had only been in this room twenty minutes snd not used anything. Room was not made up in morning and tea and coffee not replenished.
22;Overnight;Perfect location lovely big room with large bathroom views were amazing from room 4 wish we had stayed few nights will definately stay here again and highly reccommend very central for all shops . Had great night sleep beds so comfy
22;Friendly hotel;Location wise this hotel is perfect. Right in centre of town, a few minutes from all the pubs and restaurants. The castle is less than 2 mins and the same with the sea front. The owner Andrew adds a real personal touch and will meet you on arrival and answer any questions and provide suggestions for trips out and things to see. It was ideal for myself and two kids, each having our own beds and with the sunshine it was a great couple of days. Rooms are clean and well maintained and beds comfy. Would recommend as an ideal base for the island.
23;Beautiful place to stay;Gorgeous few days at St Andrews house. Natali and Tony offer a beautiful place to stay, making you feel welcome from the moment you arrive. The ambience of the house is beautiful and classy, as is the decor and attention to detail. Our room was spotless. Breakfast was hearty, well cooked and presented. The choice was varied and fresh. Would definitely recommend anyone to stay, and hopefully we’ll have the chance to return. Thanks for a lovely few days.. enjoy your new bike Tony !!!
23;Beautiful accommodation in a beautiful place!;Staying at St Andrew's House is a truly lovely experience. The hosts, Natalie and Tony have renovated this beautiful old house with the utmost care and attention to detail. Likewise, their attention to detail extends to your stay. Everything is spotless clean and of high quality including the duvet, towels and bathroom amenities. The breakfast is delicious and there is a real sense of generous hospitality from this lovely couple.
23;Beautiful B&B;Tony and Natali were wonderful hosts, welcoming us into their beautiful home. Only a short walk to the charming town of Ballater. Breakfast was outstanding! Tony is very knowledgeable about Scottish history and current events. Natali is kind and gracious. We stayed in #4 which is NOT en suite but has a private bath down the hall. I would highly recommend this lovely B&B!
23;Cosy & stylish B&B with lovely hosts;We enjoyed our stay at St. Andrews House very much. Our room was very spacious, stylish and cosy. We slept very well. The lovely hosts Natali & Tony are very kind, like to chat with their guests and help with all questions regarding sightseeing, etc. For breakfast you get coffee, tea, juice, cheese, jam, yoghurt, fruits, porridge, salmon and eggs in all varieties It is a five minute walk from St. Andrews House to the city center of Ballater and the river Dee. All very peaceful and beautiful. Balmoral Castle is a 10 minute drive away. Parking is in front of the house within the property.
23;Wonderful 2 night stay!;What a wonderful stay in a lovely place. Tony and Natalie are brilliant hosts. The décor and cleanliness is exceptional. We had the standard room with the Turret bathroom. Breakfast is ample and filling. It is only a short walk into the village, parking outside property. Balmoral is only a short drive, with beautiful walks nearby. Thankyou Tony and Natalie
23;Very nice accommodation.;We stayed two nights in a luxury double room. The hosts were warm and welcoming, the accommodation very clean, great en-suite in the turret including a good overhead shower. A lovely building, stylishly presented. Car parking immediately outside the front door. Breakfast was perfectly ok, with plenty of choice from cereals and juice, good coffee, through to various hot breakfast items. It’s a short stroll into Ballater, where there’s plenty of goodrestaurants, as there is next door. Balmoral Castle is a short drive away. (we wish there was a carpet on the landing to cushion the noise of other guests’ footsteps first thing in the morning on the wooden floor!) Would we stay again? Yes.
23;A lovely b&b;Just an overnight stay as I was playing at the beautiful Ballater Golf Club next morning. I arrived quite late but was warmly welcomed by Natalie and shown to my very nice room. The bed was very comfortable and the en-suite wet room shower was brilliant. Breakfast was excellent. Tony and Natalie were charming hosts I would definitely return.
23;Fantastic stay;We could not have wished for a better place to stay with Tony and Natalie exceptional hosts - engaging yet professional and there situation awareness meant they were always there if you needed assistance. They kindly provided a complimentary bottle of bubblies and box of chocolates for our stay which was very thoughtful and generous. The location is just outside Dornoch away from the road with ample parking. It is very modern tasteful decor not cluttered nor minimalist. We chose standard room in the knowledge that it had a double and not a king bed. There was a walk in strong shower built into turret section of house with high quality toiletries provided. The breakfast was excellent with full cooked breakfast and smoked salmon and scrambled eggs We highly recommend this B&B
23;Fabulous stay - home away from home;Tony and Natali are wonderful hosts, providing superb hospitality. It really is a home away from home, feeling welcome and comfortable the moment you step through the doors. Spacious, and oh so comfortable rooms, some of which have bathrooms in the Turrets! Our roll top bath was an added luxury after a long day walking in the gorgeous surroundings. One of the best breakfasts I have had, with great attention to detail, nothing was too much for them. Even though we changed our breakfast times several times, everything was accommodated with absolute flexibility. A definite return for us!
23;Beyond Fab;Everything is fab about this property and our stay. Fabulous hosts, breakfast, room and location. Breakfast starts at 8.30am but we had to leave early and were accommodated without any problem. Located in quiet residential area, it is only 5 to 10 minutes walk to the centre of Ballater for shops and restaurants and the Old Royal Station. Highly recommended, will stay again if in the area.
24;Great Visit, fantastic staff;Visiting Edinburgh for work and wound up with a few hours to kill between meetings and was pointed in the direction of this fantastic place on a quiet Monday afternoon.  Wasn't busy at all, but the staff were still full of enthusiasm and keen to chat.  Makes a huge difference when you're on your own.  Was even invited to stick around for a second planetarium show, which really was a nice gesture and saved a wander back out into the pouring rain, but also let me take in 2 very interesting shows.
24;Cool for kids;We went with 2 children (4 and 6 Years). They really liked it. From the time machine to the meeting ice and rainforest. Very friendly staff and educational as well
24;Not what I had hoped for;Impossible to understand from the website what was actually on offer. The walk-round tour is actually quite controlled and it's impossible to move on from one display to the next in your own time. The displays are technically quite good, but not very interesting, even to those old enough to understand them. The planetarium show was good, but lost no opportunity to lever in irrelevant references to climate change.
24;60 Years to late!;WHY wasn't this available 6o years ago when we were doing Science, History and Geology etc. at school?<br>We learnt more in a couple of hours at Dynamic Earth than we did in  a few years at school!<br>Wow, that's progress for you!<br>On arrival we had no idea of what to expect and it was a revelation from start to finish with so much interactive activities to entertain and inform <br>The Time Machine, Rocket into Space , Discover the depths of the Oceans, visit the  Ice caps, experience Volcanoes and Lava flows, venture into Tropical forests all in 4Dventure ending with the Planetarium<br>The best 3 hours spent whilst in Edinburgh and well worth the money
24;A fun and interactive experience;We booked Dynamic Earth on a day we knew we were going to climb Arthur’s Seat as they are so close to eachother. The place itself tells you a history of the earth as well as looking at animals and ecology. I felt like we learnt a lot from the experience and there were lots of interactive moments, such as going in a Time Machine back to the beginning of the universe. The only little issue is that we were told to book the planetarium for 90 minutes after the start of our experience but I felt like we were rushing slightly to see everything before that. I think if you are going for the first time or are with kids you may want slightly longer to take everything in. Apart from that, we had a great time and it was definitely worth the entry fee.
24;Won't recommend for their kid party package;Booked for 7th birthday party for 9 kids(age6-7).<br>Prior to the party, the venue confirmed I  don't need to bring napkins, forks, plates, juice or anything else unless I want to bring my own decorations or a cake. They mentioned they will have a designated party HOST.<br>Per head costs £16.50, and per party bag is another additional £4.50. The duration for the whole experience is aepund 2hrs 15mins.<br><br>The party HOST toured around with kids, but I guess depends on the age of kids and how engaging the HOST is, my group was happy to explore by themselves. And I noticed from the start, a NONE party guest joined in with his dad.......till we went to the party room.<br><br>When the tour is done, we went to the party room, the party food was prepared in the bags, and party HOST said that her duty finished......so we were left there for 30 minutes, did our own plays, BD song and cake, and we needed to go back to them for can we have plates please? Can we have napkins please? And finally I found the host to explain I thought we would have got napkins, forks, plates and water/juice there, rather than the parents running away constantly from the party?
24; ;And I explained I thought we have a party HOST to see through the whole process, hence its 16.50 per head! Rather than a normal £10.50 admission. It was very embarrassing for me and my husband needed to take turns leaving all the littles guests from the party and their parents witness us running around and the level of service we have paid!<br><br>Here comes the party food... in the bag you have either a ham roll OR cheese roll, an apples, a 6cm long milkyway, and a less than 14 cm tall juice. Feedback from the kids: it tasted horrible, the rolls don't feel fresh and felt extremely thirsty after a near 2 hrs tour in the building. They all consistently finished the milkyway.<br><br>For the party bag we bought from the venue, it said it will have things sold in the gift shop... tbh, I was wanting to do my own bags but I thought just leave it to them as it will make people feel a whole experience.... so this is what £4.50 per head includes: 4 sheets of colouring paper, a pack of 4 small palm size of colouring pencils, a round wooden keyring,a pen, a pencil and a rubber stretchy wrist wrap.<br><br>I won't recommend Dynamic Earth for a birthday party there. You could get more, better, well-organized and more happy little guests with less or the same amount of money you spent at other places.
24;Amazing Day Out;Dynamic Earth is an absolutely brilliant experience and day out, very highly recommended. <br><br>We thoroughly enjoyed the planetarium shows (one is included in the entry fee and we booked a second one) Under Pressure and Super Volcanos - really interesting and also very relaxing.<br><br>The tour around the centre is brilliant, really interactive and so much to see. The tour, although you do select a time, isn’t a guided tour, you can go sound at your own pace and go into the timed rooms as and when you’re ready to. You can’t go back on yourself though so make die you’ve seen all you want to in a room before moving on. Each room has at least one member of staff who are all full of knowledge and enthusiasm for what they’re talking about. In particular, the guy who talked to us in the rainforest area was brilliant. <br><br>Parking is underground and a bit pricey but if you’re driving you’re stuck with that really. We were there from 11am till around 3pm and it cost us just under £15.00. <br><br>There is a cafe which has a lovely bright and light seating area. They have full meals, snacks or just a cuppa and cakes. There was a slush machine too. Happily for me there was good selection of gluten free options to eat too. I had a cheese and onion panini and iced vanilla latte.<br><br>Lovely big gift shop with a huge range of gifts which I enjoyed having a look around. <br><br>I would 200% recommend Dynamic Earth to anyone visiting near Edinburgh.
24;Mange yout expectations;Not bad, needs some updating. <br><br>Planetarium was really good, well presented screen and made quite a dull topic really interesting. <br><br>Some of the exhibits are a bit dated. Loved the volcano part, but some of the others definitely need a bit of a renovation. <br><br>Overall, it was fairly decent. Wouldn't rush back, especially for the price.
24;Excellent;Brilliant! No spoilers but...<br>A unique presentation perfectly delivered using interactive and immersive techniques. Helpful staff. Thanks for a great day out. Definitely worth the money. I will be back again,  especially as the Planetarium has so many different shows.
24;Great for families;Great morning out whilst we were visiting Edinburgh. Our 5 years old loved all the displays and that you can walk around at your own pace. Planetarium also great, we watched the live ocean show and Toni was a brilliant host, really engaging.
25;The family castle!;My sister's research into the family genealogy indicates we come from the Preston clan and the Preston clan built this castle almost 1,000 years ago, so it was special for us to visit this castle or what is left of it when we visited Scotland. Not crowded and only about 4 miles from Edinburgh, so it was an easy cab ride. What a place it must have been when it was an operating Castle! Also, historic as this was the place that sheltered Mary, Queen of Scots when she was being hunted by political enemies as well as when she was recuperating from illness. You must see this place to appreciate it, and you can wander around just about all of it. Lots to see here!
25;Splendid old ruin;Breathtaking castle ruin- much more interesting than Edinburgh castle. You can imagine what it was like 600 yrs ago and they have wonderful games for kids mixed right into the ruins. There were tons of places to explore and almost get lost in and it also has very interesting garden lawn cut in the shape of unicorn heads. The people working there were very helpful and friendly and knowledgeable. It felt like going back in time set in a field in the middle of the country yet a stones throw from Edinburgh. Turrets and views and dungeons ….not to be missed!
25;Fascinating and educational visit;We have just joined Historic Scotland and this is a place which is free to members. Historically interesting place, and the visit was enhanced by a calligrapher/historian who was making bookmarks. There was also an Easter Egg trail and other activities for the kids. Definitely worth a visit, we really enjoyed ourselves.
25;Worth a visit;We wanted to visit a castle whilst we were in Scotland and this one didn't disappoint. It's a lot bigger than it looks and there is lots of information to tell you about the Castle's history. I'd definitely recommend visiting
25;Impressed;Lived in Edinburgh for 34 years and never visited. Purchased historic Scotland memberships and decided to make the most of it and visit. We prebooked and got parked there is probably about 8 spaces in the car park with one disabled space. Really friendly welcome and wish I had purchased the guide book for 2.50. We spent over an hour here investigating all the rooms and out of all the castle we have went to as someone said previously it has lots of nooks and crannies. The views of edinburgh and Arthur's seat are fabulous and we got a really sunny September day. It was pretty busy not sure if it was because it was sunny or because edinburgh castle was closed because if the queen dying. My son really liked the prison and there are a couple of games set up on the grass a bowling one and things you throw which he really liked. We could have spent longer but my son had spied the lucas ice cream on the way in and kept going on about that so we retreated back to the gift shop where we purchased ice cream tubs and juice and we're pleasantly surprised that we got 20% off being historic Scotland members. Would def recommend for locals and tourists alike
25;Marvelous historical site;If you don’t make an effort to visit this amazing place, you’ll miss out! The castle is easily accessible by public bus or you can drive there. there is limited parking at the site. By bus, you’d be dropped off near enough, for an approximate 1/2 mile walk, slight uphill Craigmillar road pedestrian sidewalk, or through the park’s beautiful and more strenuous natural path. that’s how I got there. You’ll be handsomely rewarded by an unexpected and spectacular view of the castle, as you reach the top of the path. Entrance fee is reasonable, there is a gift shop, cafe and toilets. Comfortable shoes a must. there are lots of winding stairs, nearly vertiginous, and many uneven floors, as you’d expect in an old castle. I’d say you need about two hours, to fully take advantage of the spectacular views, tranquility of the green areas and to meander and go through every single room, balconies, prison cell, cellars, etc. Most wondrous place with equally amazing history. Some limited areas inaccessible due to restoration projects, but that did not detract from the whole experience. Well worth a visit. Good explanatory signage. No handicap access and I wouldn’t recommend it for young children. Castle staff was very helpful and friendly. Absolutely loved and enjoyed my visit here and most resolutely recommend this amazing place to others. Dress in layers. the castle can feel a little cold in some areas.
25;Well worth a visit.;A most enjoyable visit - recommended by our host at our B&B. The staff and guides are excellent and so friendly! There are plenty of activities s for the under 10's. (and adults too :) ) Skittles, learning about heraldry, dressing up in medieval costume, quoits, boules etc. Well worth a visit - Outlander was filmed here (if you're a fan)
25;This is a MUST in Edinburg.;All the experience was AWESOME! Linsey was great with his personification inside the castle! my teen kids had lots of fun with him, they said it was the best castle to visit. Perfect to walk around and move free, not many people so you can take lots of great pics relax and enjoy the great views.
25;Great castle to explore.;This is an outstanding castle to be able to visit and walk around. There are lots of nooks and crannies to get into throughout the castle grounds. There are some signs to tell you about some of the rooms, but I recommend getting the guide book for more info. There weren't many people when I visited, so we could take our time and see everything without a problem.
25;Interesting Maze;First, we saw and petted Amber the cat. it's a thing here. Second, we enjoyed the experience of wandering through the maze of rooms, corridors and spiral staircases. Many more of those here than in other castles we have visited. We also enjoyed the view from the upper roof of Arthur's Seat. As members of the Historic Environment Scotland organization, which is the lead public body established to investigate, care for and promote Scotland's historic environment, our admission was free. It is but a half mile walk from the stop for bus 2. that is one of the bus routes that serve Old Town in the city center.
26;Harryhausen exhibition a must!;Came for the Harryhausen exhibition and was not dissapointed. A wonderful array of sets, models and exhibits from all of the movies, beautifully put together with interactive elements and displays.<br><br>A treat for all Harryhausen fans!
26;Cafe lets the place down;Had an amazing time at the ray Harryhausen exhibition but the cafe was awful and ruined it for us all (visited with my mother and son). There were three members of staff on the floor and they didn’t seem to have a clue what they were doing. Tables were piled high with dirty dishes and people who came in long after us were served before us. Once we managed to get the attention of staff, we waited a ridiculously long time for our order. I could see other customers were getting frustrated as well as the order we all received our food and drinks seemed quite haphazard. We also didn’t receive our full order in one go and had to remind the same member of staff that she was supposed to bring us three drinks. She seemed to be doing her best to avoid eye contact and ages fiddling with a sideboard thing in one corner. At least our order was actually worth the wait
26;The cafe converted me to quiche! Forget the art; check out the cafe! Quiche and salads were really banging (and this from a confirmed sceptic)
26;Sunshine on Bedford Road;Rain could never spoil the drama of Modern One's exterior and  the stunning 'Landform' in  front of the Gallery. Inside. Pure Sunshine.<br>   The ground floor is devoted to 'New Arrivals' including a Picasso' Jacqueline' which is full strength factor 50.<br>Upstairs is Surrealistic sunlight. There's even a Scottish 'Birth of Venus' and the Max Ernst 'Joie de Vivre' made me green with envy.<br>The temporary Joan Eardley exhibition is a summer standout of seascapes and landscapes- even if there was a wee bit of 1958 'Snow' as well.<br>      Amie Siegel film is over 80 mins so a return visit needed to fully appreciate.<br>               XXL thanks to the superb staff and to the curators for this perfect picnic of paintings.

26;Superb staff;We’ve been to Edinburgh many times to go to the Fringe. This year we visited the museum for the first time. We had only time for one of the buildings and went to One. We thought it was excellent, great exhibits and a fabulous setting. The best part was the staff .They were all so helpful and friendly. We’d not looked up the difference between One and Two .Whilst we were waiting in reception at Two a member of staff approached us and asked if could help.  Following his explanation.we decided to go to One. hen we went into the building. A member of staff asked had we been there before. When we said not , he took time to tell us the best way to go round the exhibits. The young lady who served us in the cafe was charming. As we left we asked a member of staff the best way to get to Dean . She came out of the building and explained the two ways to get there. We look forward to returning to see Two
26;Very enjoyable!;Very much worth the brief walk outside the city centre.<br><br>It’s spread across two adjacent campuses.<br><br>The grounds are also beautiful and worthy of your time in and of themselves.
26;Braved the mask mandate to not miss the Harryhausen Exhibition!;Came up to Scotland, even with the political not scientific mask mandate still in force, to see the Harryhausen exhibition. Had to come up or miss it after many months of waiting due to covid. We were not disappointed! It was really excellent, really enjoyed it. The museum shop was a bit poor for Harryhausen items however it was well worth the five hour round trip to see it. Come on Scotland drop the mask mandate and get your tourists back! We live an hour away in England with the same virus, no mask mandate and lower cases than Scotland!
26;Harryhausen. Titan of Cinema;I came up specifically to see this exhibition after having had to postpone it due to covid several times. I was not disappointed. I took in the museums too. My gosh, there is so much to absorb. Fabulous! I spent the whole day going round and then going back. I absolutely loved it. What a gem! Not only the Harryhausen exhibition itself, which for me was just a dream. But the art, the sculptures and the knowledge of those in and around the museums themselves and of course the most decorative tiles I have ever seen at Moderm Two. I need a longer visit that's for sure to explore further. My recommendation would be to give yourself more time than you plan, there is so much to see!
26;Great place;We visited Modern Two for the Ray Harryhausen exhibition which was fantastic. The gallery is bright, spacious with friendly staff. Exhibition was easy to navigate by signs. Although we didnt eat, there was a clean, spacious cafe with a good menu and a gift shop. Ladies toilets are stunning, loved the tiles! We also visited Modern One which was equally as good although the older gentleman at the door was a bit regimented. Well worth a visit.
26;Fabulous;Visited the Ray Harryhausen exhibition. We were there about 2 hours and could easily have stayed longer. So lucky to see this. Great exhibit, well done to everyone involved.
27;Small collections but worth seeing;Yes, the classical collection includes early religious art (several by Titian) and more recent European art (ex. Gainsborough). But, we anticipated much more, especially after we enjoyed several hours at the National Museum of Scotland. The adjoining Modern Art Museum includes an interesting, eclectic collection, most of which are for sale. Still, with no admission price, we were happy that we visited.
27;Beautiful museum!;The setting for this museum is beautiful. The art inside is well worth your time while in Edinburgh.
27;Not what it used to be;I regularly visit the Gallery of Modern Art (generally for lunch) as I live quite close. It’s always been a lovely place to visit, very friendly staff. but my friends and I have noticed that the grounds aren’t being as well kept as they used to be. Hopefully this can change.
27;Edinburgh does it well;My go too gallery in Edinburgh... the art is amazing with the Scottish Colorists always on view, the surprises such as Warhol and Saville, and the Eardley exhibition.  Edinburgh is lucky to have such a gem. The usual break in the café.... this is a must for a lunchtime meet up.
27;Awesome staff, beautiful art!;Good art. Loved that they have a new acquisition area, so you know where the new things are, for when you go again, which I would. Also when we went they had a staff shortage so they couldn't keep the second floor open but offered to take people interested up in family groups with an escort. So a lovely lady called Clara took my sister and I up, and I'm so glad she did there were a lot of amazing things in display that I am very glad I got the chance to see.
27;Enjoyable visit;Lovely walk up to the building through the gardens. This is free to enter however you can book tickets in advance as well. Beautiful building full of lovely art works. Staff friendly. Have visited twice recently and will be back.
27;Let's visit... SCOTTISH NATIONAL GALLERY OF MODERN ART (MODERN ONE), Edinburgh| jonjonexplores...;WHAT IT IS.<br><br>Temp and perm exhibitions. <br><br>Free entry.<br><br>TEMP EXHIBITION.<br><br>"Isaac Julien: Lessons of the Hour", with images and a film on slavery and abolitionism.<br><br>PERM EXHIBITION.<br><br>Artworks with big names including Warhol, Picasso, Matisse and Braque.
27;Be better;I don’t understand how this is classed as art, a lot of it just looks like scribbles on the canvas. I wouldn’t even  say most of the art was worthy of going in a house, let alone a museum.
27;This is not art;I just don’t get it. The art looked like it was drawn by babies. Why was there elephant dung on the painting? Lots of boobs and vaginas. Not even well very well drawn ones.
27;Very interesting museum visit;We thought this was a really interesting museum to visit. We loved some of the abstract exhibits and the layout of the rooms.
27;Very few paintings;Not many paintings very poor display. However the building was impressive. We were going to purchase a coffee in the cafe but the queue took ages so left.
27;Great experience;Really enjoyed this and not only because I managed to go here on my own and not my restless wife and kids, but because the staff were super helpful and knowledgeable.  I knew little of Scottish art and artists and left much the wider.  Not a huge gallery but one I thoroughly enjoyed.
28;Go Early;Honestly, a great historic area. It was fun to wander the streets and narrow alleys always in the shadow of the imposing castle. As the day wears on, it gets a little too crowded with tourists which detracts from it’s appeal. Everyone sells the same lambs wool scarfs, and, while my wife tried to visit every one, I quickly became bored by them all. This is a must visit but bring a couple pounds of patience.
28;History museum;History museum was amazing and so very interesting. Lots to see and read. Wonderful environment. Worth a visit
28;Charming yet terribly touristy;The Old Town of Edinburgh has a lot to offer. Lots of attraction and many nice buildings. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site together with New Town. However since it is so nice it also complety overrun by tourist.<br>May and September a crowded, June and July is overcrowded and August is so uncomfortible that even locals flee. Try to get there out of season.
28;Fun area to explore;Love the Old Town area. Lots to see and do. Some of the shops are on the touristy side while others are local made items. There is a lovely park-like area in the middle of pubs where you can enjoy lunch on a nice day. The castle is up the hill and the area itself is fun to walk around.
28;Check out Mary's Close tour!;Check out Mary's Close tour, Edinburgh Castle, King Authors seat, The Witchery, Public gardens and more.
28;Edinburgh/Glasgow;We went for a day in Edinburgh and visited the castle stunning views and did the bus tour   we were based in Glasgow and of the two I was glad we did as even in early may the amount of tourists around I can imagine what it is like in high summer !!! Had lunch at oink fantastic!! Of the two bus trips we booked Glasgow had a tour guide and found that much better than the audio headphones and long stop at one bus stop in Edinburghs tour .so yes the people for me do make Glasgow
28;One day? Spend it here!;With one day in Edinburgh, we spent the entire day in the Old Town! Highlights were Edinburgh Castle, The top and bottom of Victoria Street (inspiration for Diagon Alley in Harry Potter Books), MUMS Comfort Food, Cannongate Kirk and everywhere in between.<br>We collect stickers from each country we've been to and I went into shop after shop looking for a Union Jack, I know it's Scotland, but no one had it...and most didn't know what I was talking about. Shame in the UK to not know a Union Jack. Every tourist shop was the same, foreigners with cheap items from China and they have completely taken over the Old Town.<br>Avoid these traps and you'll have a great day exploring!
28;A must do;Great place to wander day or night. Lots of shops and pubs, plenty of bus transportation around to get you there and back. There are public toilets at the top of the Royal Mile.
28;Very quaint but now full of touristy shops;You need to take a walking tour here to understand is full historic and cultural relevance. I spent a day here, just walking around through different alleys and through the parks and gardens. The castle and museums nearby are good.
28;Full of history;Great place to immerse yourself into history and architecture of medieval Scotland.  With either a guided tour or wondering on your own, you wil not be disappointed
28;Old Town Adventure;Best area in Edinburgh, lots of streets to wander and intriguing alleyways to catch the eye. Lots of restaurants and pubs to dip into along the way!
28;What a wonderful place to explore;It is  like being in a century way back. We walked for hours through the streets. Wonderful restaurants and pubs
29;Why Moses has horns?!;Being a Harry Potter fan, New College was on my list of places to see. I hasn’t realised actually, so was excited when I realised I could see the oak tree and the cloisters pre tri wizard cup.<br>I was not disappointed at all, as the sun came out and New College looked really beautiful. <br>The Custodian who greeted us at the door, and from whom we bought our tickets, was informative, witty,  interesting and took the time to tell us key facts that would enhance our visit.<br><br>It was a shame that the grass was closed off which meant we could not get to the tree.<br>The hall was impressive as was the chapel. We were leaving the College when we asked about the chapel. That was when the Custodian/guide, told us to go back and handed us a plan of the Order of Heaven. even giving us a teaser of why does the Moses statue have horns? Definitely learnt something today! Fantastic visit.
29;Brilliant visit, top marks for Nigel.;We had already visited Magdalen College and had been disappointed as we paid the full amount and the Chapel and dining room were closed. While walking back to our car we stumbled across New College. We were greeted by Nigel on the gate he was fabulous, informative, friendly and really did make our day. We decided to go and visit New College and it was great. The Chapel is amazing, the dining room was impressive and the city walls all made this a great visit. If you only visit one college in Oxford make it this one, especially if Nigel is there to tell you all about it. Thank you Nigel for making it a special visit.
29;Most Excellent Visit;We visited New College and what a wonderful visit it was. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. The cloisters are beautiful and Harry Potter was filmed there. The chapel is a little different, but very cute. The dining hall is gorgeous, so make sure you go when it is not in use (lunch time), and the gardens are good for a nice stroll. We loved our visit. Go have a look.
29;A great, historic day;This really is a stunning place to visit and you really get your moneys worth with lots of history to see and a very serine atmosphere. <br>We very much enjoyed the enforcement of behaviour on the door, one door man was very friendly to us but would not let a party enter who were making lots of noise and running about. This is something we don't see a lot today, the enforcement of respect in such heritage sites and it was very uplifting to know our visit would be quiet and respectful especially in areas of religious value.
29;Amazing place to stay;We booked a room here to stay and it is a wonderful college to wander around, so many beautiful spaces like the cloister and the garden to see. The rooms are simple, but even in the new building it was a really comfortable nights rest lovely porters who were so helpful, would recommend spending the night if you can!
29;A peaceful place of study;We visited on a crisp autumn Saturday and the beautiful grounds of New College were fairly quiet. It's not an easy entrance to find we walked around for quite a while even though we had a rough idea where it was (if you walk under the bridge of sighs and carry on its there). There's less to see than the larger Christ Church so the entrance fee is cheaper too but definitely worth a visit. The cloisters were beautiful and looking into the quad with the lone tree its just a truly magical place and you can see why these buildings have inspired so many writers. The tree is also a film location in one of the Harry Potter films. We really enjoyed this little slice of peace in a busy tourist town but I imagine it would be busy in the week.
29;The college at the bend in the road;Do check their hours and make the visit.  The gardens in the back are delightful.  It was a highlight of our trip.
29;Rather like the tardis;This college looks nothing from the outside but if you get the chance do go in and take a look as it's really interesting once you get in!
29;Best college to visit in Oxford!;Forget Christ Church! New College is half the price, there's much more to see and and much less people visiting! I really enjoyed the cloisters and the magnificent oak tree, the dining hall was also lovely and there's actually a very nice garden at the end to see! I highly recommend a visit to New College!
29;Visit New College instead of Christ Church;To all Harry Potter fans that want to see the famous dining hall... Go to New College instead of Christ Church.  Both dining halls are very similar and Christ Church was an inspiration to the movie, the filming wasn't actually done there as it was too small for the film crew.  The price for New College is 5 pounds per person and Christ Church is 8 pounds per person.  The lineup for Christ Church is also very long and time consuming and totally not worth the money.
29;One of the most beautiful colleges in Oxford;New College is one of the least busy, and one of the most beautiful colleges in Oxford. New has both the stunning buildings to compete with any of the other colleges, but it is unique in that it has great stretches of the old town walls running through it, which are well worth exploring, and the mysterious mound on the lawn. In addition, the stone carvings in the chapel are breathtaking and the cloisters are probably the best in Oxford (and is where some filming was done for Harry Potter). There is plenty to explore in the college and I would definitely recommend it.
29;Beautiful;This is a lovely college. Sadly the hall was closed the day we were there but the cloisters are delightful and the gardens lovely, backing up against the old city walls.<br>Well worth a visit. I’ll go again next time.
