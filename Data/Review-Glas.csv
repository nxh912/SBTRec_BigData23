1;amazing and emotional;Hi, <br>was on the tour last night (15/11/2022) Jackie was our tour Guide, absolutely amazing tour, the passion Jackie showed for her job was brilliant. the information we found out about our city was truely emtional and educatonal. My husnad and 2 sons attended and Jackie catered for all ages, even a 12year grmupy boy,  who was reluctant to attend was  laughing!:) <br><br>could not reccommend the tour enough, when the steam train arrives we will be booking again! Jackie is your golden nugget. thankyou Jackie for educating us and reminding us what a great train station Glasgow Central really is (also our City) makes you go home feeling proud <br><br>Vicki Miller
1;High Degree of Accessibility;One of Scotland’s more accessible large train stations. Unlikely Queen Street, the toilets remain free to anyone needing access to their (essential anyway, but doubly so to those of us with disabilities). Staff generally on hand for any support required, good number of self-service machines, etc.. Signage is consistent, with the only real issue ever occurring being how the huge queues that emerge to the left-most side of the station are ordered - limiting ease of movement around this part of the station during particularly busy times.
1;Central Station day out;We had a great day on the Glasgow Central Station tour, Jackie was extremely knowledgeable and passionate about all aspects of the tour. Having been in the station many times over the years it was very interesting to see the parts of the station that are no longer open to the general public.<br><br>The museum was very interesting and it was good to see it in the flesh as we had seen Jackie talk about it on the television programme . We would highly recommend the tour to anyone who wants to know more about the history of this fabulous station.<br><br>Outside the museum is a slide show about the role the station played in the repatriation of the armed forces of the Great War, a very sobering episode .<br><br>We will go again and hopefully see the Victorian platform when it is refurbished. A most enjoyable day out, thanks in no small measure to our fabulous tour guide Jackie
1;Cenrtal station tour;The Central Station Tour was excellent. Paul our tour guide was wonderful he told the history of the station in a way we all could relate to , what a wonderful tour never knew much about the history of the station until now it really was fascinating, I Would recomend  it to anyone of all ages. As I said Paul was wonderful and extremely witty<br>Well done to everyone involved..
1;Glasgow Grand Station Historical Tour;The tour was brought to life by the knowledge of the tour guide, retired station master from Paddington and many other large mainline stations. He is passionate about the long history of Glasgow central station and believes that this must be passed on to future generations. His teams untiring work of unearthing, literally, past histories and continually adding to the tour agenda, showing some of the two square miles of the station in areas not available for general access.<br>Definitely worth the tour especially for engineers, an interest in railways, Glasgow's development history enabled by railways. <br>If it’s a dreich day in Glasgow this is the tour to take - could be sunny when you return to the surface.
1;Glasgow Central station  tour;The whole tour is outstanding ,the stories Paul tells  really bring to life the history of the station. His enthusiasm  and genuine love of the station and Glasgow is palpable <br><br>My favourite part was Standing underground on the Victorian platform looking along the old tunnel and catching a glimpse of a train in another tunnel.<br><br>You may come with memories I guarantee you will leave with many more.
1;Central Station Tour;I attended this tour today, I had high hopes as I’ve wanted to do it for years and it surpassed my hopes and expectations. Paul was our guide and his passion for the station was infectious. He tells stories with heart, warmth and humor  and brings history to life. I highly recommend the tour and I look forward to going again to see the forthcoming changes.
1;An excellent experience;This tour was excellent. It was very enthusiastically led by our guide, Jackie,  who gave us a full history of the station, from its development in Victoria times through to present day and included Glasgow's industrial and social history.  She was very informative and also very entertaining.  We were shown three levels from the main concourse of Central Station down to the bowels below including an original lower platform, which awaits further development in future. The newly opened station museum was very interesting too, containing many artifacts which I could remember from childhood. Very nostalgic and highly recommended.
1;First class Victorian station tour in the heart of the city.;History tour brought alive by  the knowledge and passion of the tour guide Jackie. <br>This is a fantastic tour of this Victorian Train Station from the industrial Revolution through the First World War and Second to the present day. <br>A must do tour for visitors and locals of the city. <br>Can’t believe the knowledge I gained on this tour.
1;Pro’s and Con’s;There are pros and cons to this station for me, the cons being that the station is a bit grubby and it’s busy and the toilets are down a flight of stairs which is not easily accessible if you have luggage. The pros however is that the seating and the departure board is perfectly situated and there is a costa coffee to sit in and wait if your like me and always way to early. So I had a pleasant enough experience, I wasn’t wowed but it’s not the journey it’s the destination as they say!
1;Central Station Glasgow at its best!;Meeting family for a day trip up from England for an afternoon tea with Prosecco at the Grand Central Hotel. The train arrived on time and we were allowed on the platform to meet my family off their carriage. The staff we met were all very professional and pleasant and the weather was beautiful and sunny so showed the station off at its best! The station was spotlessly clean and the ability to walk directly into the Grand  Central Hotel from the station is ideal! Will definitely be doing this again as everyone enjoyed the experience so much !
1;Classic Railway Station;A classic Victorian train station which has been cleaned up recently (for episodes of "Inside Secrets").  Stonework, colonnades, glass and lead ceiling - what's not to love?  Good signage for toilets, platforms, tickets, help, etc.  Visitor Assistance staff wearing blue vests were readily available and helpful in understanding how to read the electronic platform signs and where to stand.  Plenty of shops and spots to eat.
2;The 3-rd railway station in Glasgow;Glasgow Queen Street railway station is situated on one end of Queen Street, very close to George Square. This railway station was built by Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, and was inaugurated in 1842.<br>Me and my wife, we came in this railway station when we traveled from Irvine.<br>We saw an enough large station, and we appreciated the impeccable service.
2;Refurbished station;Queen Street station serves the North and East of Scotland. Recently refurbished, there are 7 platforms on  high level and 2 on the lower level. Lifts to the low level are through the gate line on the high level. There are no shops in the station but Buchanan Street is only a few minutes away.
2;Queen Street Station in the heart of Glasgow;The smaller of the 2 main stations in Glasgow and the third busiest railway station in Scotland. Very near to Glasgow central station.  All the Scot rail trains for Edinburgh departs from here. Staff very helpful. Enjoy your journey.
2;Great every time;The station has been upgraded over the last couple of years and looks great. Coffee / food stalls seem expensive but they are convenient and I guess that is what you are paying for. Nice coffee. Worth it in my opinion. One thing that has been consistent over the many years I’ve used this station and train line is the level of professionalism and friendliness of the rail staff. Thank you.
2;Where 2022 meets 1986;It’s a nice compact station but with very few facilities. On a Sunday evening the tinderbox counter which closes at 1700 was turning away customers from 1645 as apparently their drinks machine had broken shortly before closing. After 1700 on a Sunday there seems to no catering even though the station is busy. Other problems are the serious lack of seating and the well hidden toilets which require a 10 shilling coin to access.
2;Disappointment in a shell;I’m not sure how this could ever have been called a refurbishment as it has almost none of the facilities we would expect of a city station in 2022, apart from trains. It’s absolutely retrograde to charge 50p for the toilets.  I was there just after 7 this morning and they were shut   I was told that “the guys from lost property might open them after 730am”<br>There doesn’t seem to be anywhere to buy a newspaper or magazine. <br>At best, you could say it’s ‘uncluttered’. <br>As with a lot of things sadly in an otherwise fantastic city, there does not seem the will to change things for the better or to care.
2;Striking new gold and glass design of Queen Street station;Glasgow Queen Street Station has undergone major redevelopment over the last three years and is now completely transformed. The gold and glass building is striking and is utterly different to the original structure. I used the station on my most recent visit and the station was mostly complete but there were a lot of restrictions in place because of Covid-19.
2;Appalling;This was our first visit since the refurbishment and its probably worse now than it ever was.<br>With toilets are hidden tucked under a flight of stairs and the signs are round the corner so noone can see them, theres very few seats or shops and a terrible concourse layout.<br>The toilets are 50p to get in but they don't even supply toilet paper or a clean toilet or even a toilet door that locks? As the catch's seem to be too small to reach the other side.<br>It's completely shocking after a full refurbishment!
2;Needs modernised;The new station has so many issues. Very few retail units. Very little seating. No water fountain. One of the few uk stations not to have free toilets and expects people to carry 50p coins in 2022. Oh and locates the toilets down a flight of stairs. It’s really poor and will hopefully be modernised soon.
2;50p a pee;I needed to go to the toilet at Queen street station, and they have barriers stopping you and charging 50p!!. After rummaging in my purse I found one, put it in the machine and lost it as the gate would not open. A young boy was coming out and managed to hold the barrier open enough for me to get through.<br> Outrageous! This station has been getting renovated for years now but is just the same, except for the high toilet prices. I don’t know what’s going on there but forget toilets.
2;Ready for when lockdown passes;This station has had a major refit and is now looks ready for the future. A ghost town because of lockdown but whenever life returns to normal ( whenever that will be) it will serve commuters well. For those who don't know it, Queens street  is the main station to Edinburgh Waverly and North Glasgow.
2;Improvement for the most part;The New station is much brighter and cleaner. Now. I mainly to use the low level trains to get to Glasgow but it's the best place to get a train to Edinburgh and further North. It has lifts to all levels and the new screens are an upgrade from the older ones. A lot of staff there and ready to help. The on ok y downside is the limited number of outlets but you would never starve
3;;Easy to get to, parking was good, security is usually pretty quiet and it’s generally tidy. The easyJet gates tend to have a lot of space but the queues can stand for a while before you actually board. All in all, a decent airport to fly from and return to.
3;;The airport is quite small and it's very crowded. The security checks were not that great and they even poured my drinking water down the sink. I have never experienced something like that in other airports. Moreover, the duty-free shops are not classy as expected and many changes can be brought inside the airport. It will be great if there is proper management of the crowd inside and more security check gates should be opened as there are many flyers these days. Only go through this airport if you have an emergency, otherwise, definitely go for Heathrow.
3;;I had an excellent experience flying from here. Easy to park, fast check in and through security, good shops and a choice of places to eat. Great scenic views as well.

3;;Glasgow Airport has definitely improved over the years. The Customs counters seem to be working efficiently and dont take extensive amounts of time to check baggage etc. The overall variety available once you are in the lounge is rather limited in terms of restaurants however give the size of the airport it does suffice. Facilities are clean and overall clearly marked.

Facilities are clean and overall clearly marked.
3;;Used to be a very good, efficient and easy airport. Now with all the desks being manned by Menzies rather than the individual airlines it is a disaster. There is always a queue winding round the entire check-in floor for BA. My OH and I fly frequently and I can’t remember the last time a flight to Heathrow departed on time.  Yesterday with a queue backed up into domestic arrivals, there were 2 Menzies staff sitting at desks for Logan chatting. In half an hour they had one passenger check in. Complete mis-management and unwillingness to try to make it run better. Security is quick and easy, duty free is centrally located and well stocked, with a good range of Scotch, though more gins would be nice. There are a few options for food/drink - nothing great, but adequate. A Starbucks, Boots and WH Smith are again, well located prior to departure gates. There was a period when you could expect to wait over an hour for a taxi but thankfully this seems to have been sorted now. The bus service is good and runs to the centre of town every 15 minutes - it can sometimes be very busy but like the taxis this seems to be being handled a little better Something needs to be done about check-in as it has a knock-on effect on all flights and the airport as a whole.
3;;This is a big shout out for Denise and her team at Glasgow Taxis airport desk who found and safeguarded my lost passport, they went above and beyond, including calling my emergency contact to organise a safe return. An unpleasant situation was averted and became an extremely positive experience!
3;;Despite all the warnings from Easy Jet there was no queue at security and though I allowed 2 hours it only took 5 minutes to get through The flight was delayed by over an hour so plenty of time to shop, sit and chill. Free WiFi for an hour which was handy.
3;;It's small and not much to do before you pass through to the departure lounge, but once there you'll find some decent shops and a good range of duty free. Not on a par with a Paris train station but it's ok.  Didn't like seeing the Rangers/Celtic stores!
3;;Again, 7 months later, using Glasgow airport I find it as good as before. Security was quick and efficient, the staff very pleasant. Useful shops inside, again with helpful staff. Free charging points, note public seating could be a little closer (nitpicking!) Toilets clean and in good condition. Altogether a pleasant experience. I flew into Glasgow Airport (March 2022), for the first time this week and found the whole arrivals experience very quick. I easily found the pick up (and drop off) lanes directly opposite the main building exit. It was so easy to be collected safely and efficiently. The collection was very quick, under 10 minutes, and the cost was £4 on exit. You are quickly back into the main traffic lanes and away.
4;Temporarily closed until further notice;COMPARED TO OTHERS, NOT THE WORST!!!
4;Compared to airports down south, Glasgow is not soo bad. We were able to progress through it without too much delay, and, our plane was only 30 minutes late to take off.<br><br>T2 has now re-opened, so that will help passenger flow considerably.<br><br>On the down side - they now charge £4 to use the drop off facility, even though we were stopped for 1 minute, that's £240 per hour!!!;I would try to avoid using Glasgow airport
4;Check inn and security was ok although we passed through airport early on a Sunday morning and airport was very quiet. Once in departure lounge I found the options to eat very poor, extremely over priced and of poor quality. On return to airport imigration went fairly smoothly but we waited more than 1 hour aftee this for the baggage to start being placed on the reclaim belt, a member of staff explained another flight had arrived a little earlier and this was the reason for delay, really can Swissport only deal with 1 flight at a time..;Dump of an airport.
4;After a couple of years off due to Covid we flew at last to Lanzarote from Glasgow . The experience at the airport was poor and forgettable Bad points  , Security slow and invasive staff ill mannered Food and drink poor selection over priced vastly , only 2 bars open queues at both to even get in . JD Weatherspoons closed for good , shame . No moving pavements now to gates  , shocking . Overall the place is a dump staff poor not friendly or customer focused  . Good points Jet2 staff superb from start to finish .;Superb Special Assistance
4;A party of 5 of us travelled from Glasgow to Charles de Gaulle and returned.  Two in the party needed special assistance and all I can say is that the assistance from the porters/ambassadors was five star from start to finish.  Taken to baggage drop off, through security and taken to the aircraft going out.  On return taken from the aircraft by hoist and greeted at the bottom by porters ready and waiting with wheelchairs.  Again taken through passport control to baggage reclaim and to our awaiting transport.  Couldn’t fault anyone so nice, kind and considerate and also very funny.<br><br>Charles de Gaulle has a lot to learn from Glasgow Airport.<br><br>This 5 star service was going out on the 13th October and returning on 16th October 2022<br><br>A great big pat on the back to all of those who helped the girls in my party get around swiftly and made the journey enjoyable;Horrible!!!
4;Disgrace! I flew out of Prestwick airport in July 2019. We had a really nice holiday but when we returned, I was made aware of some heavy flooding in the area. To cut a long story short, my car was damaged beyond repair, which the airport took absolutely responsibility for. The FORCED me to claim for this on my insurance, so now I am left paying a premium every month for the airport failing to provide a duty of care to their customers. No only that, but the staff were extremely rude and showed no sympathy to the situation THEY ha put me and my three samll children in.<br>I will never fly from this airport again! Unless you want to come home from your holiday to a damaged car, boycot this airport. <br>I also spoke to a couple of reporters on my return and the advised that this had happened numerous times in the past and that the airport had covered it up. Whatever you do, don't leave your car in Carpark 3!!!;A little bit depressing
4;Temporarily closed until further notice;New Norm
4;Never seen the airport so quiet !! Hand sanitizers everywhere, social distancing, very few shops open, no testing and mandatory masks.....not nice;CHAOTIC!!!
4;On Friday 17th May, between 01.00 and 02.00, 9 planes landed at the airport.<br>Obviously, no-one thought to tell the Border Force, as they only had 3 of 9 desks manned!!!<br><br>This resulted in an enormous queue of weary travellers that stretched all the way back to the point where we entered the terminal from the concourse.<br><br>Border Force then herded the queue towards the automated booths where the unwary were subjected to Facial Recognition Technology and were fingerprinted.<br><br>THIS IS VOLUNTARY!!! It violates section 8 of the Human Rights Act - respect for privacy.<br><br>We refused to do this, and instead said we wished to be seen by a person - which we were.<br><br>A\s yet, the government have not introduced compulsory fingerprinting of all citizens, and there is currently a case before the high court complaining about the polices' unauthorised use of Facial Recognition Technology.;beware James Martin
4;arriving before a flight felt a bit peckish. Thinking James Martin meant class and a good experience I ordered a burger with double cheese... sit down before reading this £11.50... a bum with a thin burger and all sorts of tomato lettuce... no chips... no drink... and you even have to go up and collect it... no table service... not a single table has been cleaned in the half hour I have been here. plastic cutlery. Well wonder what the mark up is. I would guess 200%. Poor show and a complete rip off. Never to return;Can only vouch for passenger assistance - 5* for assisted travelling
5;an excellent first time experience for someone in a wheelchair;i attended concert on wednesday 20th april 2022. i phoned the accessibility dept. to explain that after a stroke i would be  unable to take my original seat. scott explained he would notify box office and not to worry. on arrival a steward lead me to the box office , where they very quickly sorted my seats so that i could stay in my wheelchair. a very nice steward stayed with me while i waited for my son to arrive. we were directed to our seats very efficiently
5;Jimmy Carr gig.;My wife and I went to see Jimmy Carr. The show was excellent. The venue was pretty well organised despite the looming covid 19 pandemic. I think the only down side was that the bars was on the ground floor and unfortunately we were in the nose bleeds, there were small bars on each floor but the ones I seen was closed. Great night though.
5;Futuristic venue;Went to see George Thorogood and the Destroyer.....There is a multi-story car park for the SEC, watch for the sign painted on the road. Why is the car park in front of the building barricaded off, be easier to park there? It is an interesting building, like a small metal version of the Sydney Opera House. Inside it is quite soulless in an almost futuristic way. 2 bars, (one was closed). Seating, sound and view was good. Able to get out of the auditorum and car park easily
5;Organisation was terrible;Our email said “collect tickets at venue” for Paw Patrol Live so my excited 3yo and I arrived at the venue at doors open time, queued for 40 minutes in the rain while the doors were not, in fact, open, and arrived at the front of the queue to be told that we actually had to collect tickets from the box office in a separate building. We went to the separate building and saw that there was one sign, facing the railway bridge, about the box office collection. Anyone arriving from any other direction could not have known. The box office queue was full of annoyed parents like me, with kids in tow. We then had to join the back of the queue again, in the rain.<br><br>It had been advertised that prams could be brought to the venue, and with it being an event for toddlers and young children, many parents had. However, there was nowhere to leave prams! They ended up abandoned in doorways and at the bottoms of escalators. Surely a venue hosting an event for thousands of young children cannot be surprised and ill-prepared when thousands of young children show up?!<br><br>Fortunately none of this spoiled the actual show for my daughter who loved seeing her favourite pups on stage and seemed blissfully unaware of her mother’s nerves being in tatters!
5;No room for dancing at Jools.....;Jools Holland , Stalls, Row H. Stopped by an aggressive Usher lady when I was walking towards group of dancers in front of stage. Told I wasn't allowed to go up to dance. Ruined the atmosphere for me for the rest of gig. Front rows having a whale of a time up dancing stage front while the rest of us are disciplined and restricted to standing dancing on the spot within our seat area. Not good or fair. Won't go again.
5;I have no words.;The actual venue was fine.  The show, Haters Roast Ru Paul was absolutely appalling.  Not funny at all, American humour is the pits.  It was so bad people walked out.  Even the act was asking people to laugh.  I get the idea is to  character assassinate each other.  It was racist, anti semitic, laughing at the death of Princess Diana, laughing at what happened in Auschwitz.   The c u next Tuesday word constant! Shouting it out all through the act.  Now I can take a joke as good as the next person, however this crossed the line.  Absolutely never again! I’ve been to several Ru Paul shows and had a fantastic night! But this?  Disgusting!
5;Dolls show;1st time here in ages found  staff not so helpful and glum especially girl on info desk didn't look intrested. Main auditorium was ok clear view and sound OK but prefer hydro
5;Help;Very concerned about visiting the Armadillo for Swan Lake tomorrow night with an elderly friend with walking difficulties and heart problem but not regarded as 'disabled' the walk from multi storey car park will not be possible. Can anyone advise me please
5;Bill Bailey concert;The concert was great and a sell out however the upstairs bar was not open and the two that were open were painfully slow , so much so my partner missed the first 5minutes of the 2nd half - good venue and close to city centre but really need to look at the demand inside for drinks and snacks
5;Harry Styles;This venue is great. Fully seated, great stage views, excellent acoustics. <br><br>Very easy to get to, rail links, bus stop nearby, fully served taxi rank.<br><br>Staff very friendly and helpful. Was surprised at the seeming lack of security checks however, despite being told to bring photo ID, I wasn't asked for it. <br><br>100% would attend a show here again.
5;Connor mcgregor;I missed the first half of Connor McGregor coming on as I waited an hour to be served at the top bar! Only 2 servers and cash only was an absolute joke to make it worse it was absolutely boiling waiting in the queue! Surely this place would have known it was going to busy busy with Connor McGregor and would have made sure they had more than enough staff 😤
5;Miranda Lambert in Glasgow;The smaller of the Exhibition Centre venues, the Clyde Auditorium (more commonly known as the Armadillo because of the architecture) seats around 3000 over three tiered levels - stalls, circle and gallery.  These levels are sub-divided into front and rear sections.<br><br>It’s a modern looking building inside and out and shares parking facilities with the other venues on the large site.<br><br>Bar facilities inside are functional - there is no seating and wine for example is sold in a sealed plastic “glass” at £6.50/£7.00, the same price we paid for a large (250ml) real glass of wine across the way at the SEC’s Clydebuilt bar which does have seating (some of it not very comfortable…think metal tractor seat).   Clydebuilt also sells food but there are a host of better places within walking distance.<br><br>Seating in the arena was very comfortable - decent leg and elbow room in the stalls based on our most recent experience.  As is common at many concerts we didn’t have a lot of time to enjoy them since as soon as the main act appeared people were on their feet for the entire show.   We had seats X26 and 27, four rows from the back of the Rear Stalls and central to the stage so the view was good although a bit distant.  The carpet was a bit sticky probably with spilt drinks which you are permitted to take into the arena provided they’ve been bought there!<br><br>We found the sound quality was good - the support act was Ward Thomas who were on for a brief 30 minute set, followed by Miranda Lambert who was accompanied by eight musicians in her band.  Some of the more rousing numbers were a bit distorted sound-wise but in quieter moments the vocals were excellent.   The spot lighting of Ms Lambert was extreme and she often appeared as a white glow on stage but that may be down to her own crew.   Miranda controversially didn’t play an encore at this event for reasons unknown (she did mention at one point that she expected the audience to be more wild) but we enjoyed it nonetheless and were only “robbed” of three songs she included in her set everywhere else on the tour.<br><br>The venue website provides approximate timings for the acts a day or two before the event which helps plan the night e.g. for this event the doors opened at 6.30pm, the support act appeared at 8.00pm and the main act at 9.00pm until around 10.20pm.<br><br>There is a good train link from Exhibition station, a short covered walk from the venue, to Glasgow City Centre.  We stayed overnight on this occasion at the fairly new Premier Inn Pacific Quay which is a few minutes walk across the Bell’s Bridge and has it’s own secure car park.  It was ideal for this venue.<br><br>From this and past experience of attending a concert at the Armadillo I’d try for seats in the front stalls if available, failing which possibly the front circle.  The gallery is distant and there are no large screens so take binoculars if you want to see the act up close.
6;Giant Concrete Bridge;This is an odd attraction for Glasgow. The Kingston Bridge is a well-known part of the M8 motorway in Glasgow and the busiest bridge in Europe, carrying over 150k cars everyday over the River Clyde. The bridge is a singled arched bridge spanning the entire 150m width of the river. <br><br>It's also vehicle bridge only and I've driven over it many times. Unless your car has broken down, you're likely to be paying attention to the motorway than admiring the views. The bridge isn't much to look at even when walking along the river as it's little more than a giant and plain concrete bridge.
6;Kingston Bridge has stood the tests of time. I remember going over this first in the 1970s;When it opened the traffic was very light and it was a pleasure to use it. Today it is more like a race track with jams at rush hours and cars jumping from lane to lane.<br>Now always seems to be busy but still doing a good job nearly 50 years on.
6;It's a Bridge;Had to say I laughed when I saw this has a trip advisor account. I'm hoping this is a weird side effect of Glasgow humour. For non Glaswegians this is a motorway bridge linking to the M8 that makes regular appearance on travel news for Glasgow. For Glaswegians it's often a junction to be avoided and can have tail backs and roadworks seemingly as frequently as it rains. I'm baffled it's on trip advisor and hope no one goes out of their way to view it!
6;Not an attraction;This is just a road bridge, nothing to see here for tourists or locals,  not sure why its even listed as an attraction
6;It's a bridge;This isn't a tourist attraction. It's an ugly road which happens to be a above water. A road which should you attempt to traverse will leave you ample time to revel in it's misery due to traffic bottlenecks. It has high sides which prevent you from seeing anything, presumably as a ward against jumpers. If you do want to jump off a bridge don't choose this one. It's rubbish.
6;Stand under it, rather than drive over it!;Not a  tourist attraction to be honest, but if you are a visitor to Glasgow you will almost certainly be driven over it on an airport transfer bus, or in your rental car!  It carries the M8 motorway (freeway) over the River Clyde and is the busiest road-river crossing in Europe.  The hidden gem is actually to stand underneath it when taking a stroll along the riverbank (the north bank is best - short walk from Argyle Street and the Marriott/Hilton hotels, although daytime is definately recommended rather than at night!!).<br><br>Despite being a pretty unattractive monolithic Brutalist concrete structure, it has a strange cathedral-like vista underneath, from which you can appreciate its sheer scale (at the time of its construction it was the biggest cantilevered concrete box bridge in the world of its span ever attempted). - totally at odds with the likely traffic chaos going on directly above which you can't see.  Don't go out of your way to do it, but if you are in the area.....pause for a few minutes to take it in.
6;A Bridge...but so much more;Ok..another bridge.  I only review as for the photographer in you ..interesting shots to be taken, especially underneath if you are walking the Clyde.  Not much more to say really !
6;Don't go over this during rush hour!;This is the main bridge over the Clyde.  However please avoid this route during rush hour times as it becomes whacky races with cars swapping lanes at high speed.
6;Falling Down?;Amaing how a modern bridge can have structural problems in the past (I assume all fixed) An interesting bridge but nothing remarkable. Worth passing over at high speed by car - Never walked it? not ure you can?  Go underneath and look up thats the best viewpont
6;Just another concrete bridge;I'm amazed that this bridge has an entry on tripadvisor, its just another concrete motorway bridge although it is admittedly very important to the road network within Scotland. We were last across it just a few days ago. A few years ago I was, with my family, stuck in our car in the dark for about 15 minutes after leaving a concert at the SECC waiting for the traffic jam to clear. We were astounded to see a family of foxes moving about across the area totally unconcerned about all of the cars sitting within yards of them.
6;;
7;A Hidden Monument on the University Grounds;I walked from George Square to Glasgow Cathedral and on the way stopped on the grounds of The University of Strathclyde. There is a park named Rottenrow Gardens, tucked into a side street, and it contains a plaque and sculpture commemorating The Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital. It is worth a stop to see the giant diaper pin, take your picture with it if you were born here, and read the beautifully written memorial. At the edge of the park, stands the original entryway to the hospital. There are lots of places to sit before you continue walking to the cathedral or the cemetery behind it.
7;One of best;The University of Strathclyde is indeed one of the best universities in the world, and you will never be disappointed.
7;2nd university I've been to.;This is actually better than the other one. But just don't expect anything from admin. Overpriced printer charges and can't reduce costs by default option print double sided so may as well print single sided to get your money's worth and have a side to write notes on.
7;Good place to study;This is the first time I visited this university although I have been living in Scotland for years. Most of the buildings of the university are located close together within a few blocks. Traveling to university is easy as it is in the city center. Atmosphere is great. Good neighbourhood and surroundings. Definitely a great place for students.
7;Uni of strathclyde;It's was really good I enjoyed it this was for my brother about 5 years ago but he didn't get it I'm sure if you are just starting or looking for a uni then strathclyde is for
7;Great Central Glasgow Uni;The University of Strathclyde is situated in Glasgow City itself. It has a wonderful main building and sits in well maintained gardens. I sat and marvelled at the architecture in the tranquil grounds!<br><br>It is a wonderful place to visit and good for excercise (walking and cycling, beware the hilly terrain). It is close to the city centre and Glasgow Cathedral.
7;Fantastic course!;5 year Mechanical engineering course. The lecturers are fantastic! I have joined loads of clubs, and rottenrow gardens are just so peaceful to sit in!
7;Fantastic people;Warm welcome straight away . Students Reception  work all together to take you and assist you in what your needs or likes are . These people don't have to do this they do it as that just the way they  are good people
7;Good University in Central Glasgow;A visit to the library is recommended.<br>Great selection of books and journals.<br>Visit Starbucks at entrance and take your coffee into the library if you wish.
7;I studied here, so I have to rate it excellent!;Campus is changing all the time. Hardly recognise it now to when I studied here. Close to city centre but beware the hills! provided my daily exercise for the 5 years I studied here. Close to Glasgow Cathedral, Provans Lordship (oldest house in Glasgow) and Glasgow Museum of Religion, so you can combine visits.

8;amazing;I attend glasgow caledonian university and study nursing. I find the university both warming, contemporary and student friendly. I would highly recommend you to study here.!
8;Mature Student and loved my time at the University;Enjoyed my time here as a mature student and found the course interesting.  I would recommend return to study to anyone who wants to change direction.  I had be made redundant and found the challenge of going back into education stimulating, interesting and it made it easier to find work.
8;lovely;really nice uni,the staff are very helpful,  its in the perfect place right in the city. ideal for students right near everything
8;Good students, terribly lazy staff and management;GCU has some great people, however it suffers from poor management. <br><br>If you like exams this is the place for you, gcu seems to love exams that are over 4/5 hours long that are entirely made up of essay questions<br><br>Students with disabilities are left behind and not provided with proper support. Maybe you’ll get the extra time you’re supposed to have, maybe not. Delivered content is inconsistent, not properly sourced and in some cases even derogatory to people with disabilities. It's a shame because the disability team are incredibly understanding and helpful but clearly are unable to make an impact on staff that don't care.<br><br>Don't go here.
8;full of stupids sorry students;being glasgow 3rd university, it seems to be full of particullarly foolish students. i know students play pranks, but the kids here just seem to have no common sence at all. i would give this a wide berth except maybe in summer holidays. visit glasgow university it has much much more to offer.
8;Study event;The campus is very clean and situated not far from all public transportation links. Has a really good restaurant on site along with many smaller coffee shops. Extensive library facilities with staff willing and able to assist, signposting fantastic to all buildings. Parking in city at reduced rates if you validate ticket on campus.
8;The new university;Glasgow is home to University of Strathclyde and University of Glasgow, two top rated Universities with great campuses, specially Uni of Glasgow.  This is a much newer university with a all building, nothing much to visit for tourists.
8;Modern University;If you are not a student or university worker then there is little point in visiting what is frequently a building site. This is a modern university with an impressive library space and social areas. They put on interesting lectures and student shows etc. The gym is of a high standard. But in terms of visiting as a tourist there is not a lot to see and one would be better visiting Glasgow university instead.
8;Alumni;The best place to be for studying abroad. Well guided... At times late in responses but still I met some of my best friends here n today we are spread worldwide!
8;Great Place to Study;I've loved studying at GCU, the teaching staff are brilliant and very supportive. <br>I love being involved in the SA and making many new friends through it! Lovely place.

9;Access and great stories;We enjoyed the tour of the university offered by Louise, who was eager to share lots of details and the stories behind the history of the University making it come alive. The history was linked to the larger stories of the city of Glasgow, which made our additional days of exploring the city much richer. Would definitely recommend!
9;Grand Architecture and Beautiful Grounds;The University is not far from the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. The grounds are picturesque and worth walking around it can be very peaceful and restful. The architecture in some of the main buildings is in the Gothic style and their grandeur makes an emphatic statement. Well-maintained, this is an impressive campus and one worth visiting.
9;Guided tours are always worth it.;Guided tours are always worth it.<br>Unfortunately I forget the girls name.<br>Very informative, showing architecture, history and things you wouldn't pot just walking round.<br>We also visited the Hunterian Art Gallery and Mackintosh house.<br>Well worth a visit to the Uni, gallery and CRM house.
9;University Guided Tour;We booked online for the 1 hour guided tour. Really easy to book, meet and well organised. Our tour guide (forget her name unfortunately but is studying archaeology) was fantastic: very knowledgeable and engaging. Was great to see the outside and inside and hear about the history. A quick visit to the Hunterian museum afterwards was also great, free and lots of interesting exhibits. All in all an enjoyable hour.
9;Stunning architecture plus a Museum and Art Gallery.;Totally beautiful campus with stately buildings and an amazing arched plaza area.  And many ornate red stone buildings and green lawns.<br><br>The Museum was eclectic, covering interesting artifacts from Roman times and electrical inventions of some of Scotland's great scientists.  Well presented and in a spacious building.  Open to the public with booking and free, as was the Art Gallery.<br><br>The Art Gallery presented an extensive collection of James Whistler's paintings that spanned several approaches to modern art.
9;University of Glasgow dripped with History and Heritage;The University of Glasgow is one of the finest in the world and enjoys 550 years of history.  Founded by papal bull in 1451, it is the fourth oldest English language university and in good company along with Oxford, Cambridge, and St. Andrews.  Trinity College, University of Dublin was not founded until 1592.  Its baccalaureate degree is a M.A. (Master of Arts) whereas true masters’ degrees are specialized (ex. M.Litt).<br>  <br>Some of the famous Glasgow graduates include Thomas Muir, a radical revolutionary, and John Smith, a former leader of the Labor Party. Being that I am a retired University administrator, I was very excited to tour the University with a student guide. Later, I visited the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery. Of course, I had to purchase as University T-shirt in Scottish Gaelic.
9;Is this Hogwarts?;Beautiful buildings that must be the inspiration for jk Rowling. It was a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon, walking around these buildings- so beautiful. Makes me wish I were a lot younger to attend classes here.
9;Alumi - And i still love walking round;There's so much to see and do around Glasgow University. I was a student here from 1991-1995 (wow i'm old!) and i didn't appreciate how much there was to see and do around the campus. Okay we all know about The Cloister and it's fame in the movie Chariots of Fire in my day. More recently Outlander and Cloud Atlas.  But there's so much more to see just by wandering around and into the old historic buildings. Also out the back of the university you get great views across the city. Highly recommended
9;University of Glasgow;Loved seeing the cloisters on the second level of the main building.  What a big and glorious university taking up several blocks of buildings.  The Hunterian museum and the Mackintosh House are worth a visit too.  I would return to take more photos.  It's a short walk from the Hillhead metro station.
9;Incredible building;I really like these old buildings with incredible architecture. It’s great to walk around the campus admiring the building and the skill that went into it. It’s a short walk through the park from Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum.

11;crackin;God i have never inmy pittsburgh life have i been to such a culturally rich gem in the heart of a small diamond, in the sunny climbs of Scotland. Simply breath taking the atmosphere engulfs you with its history and architecture and the students are so individual and alive with enthusiam. For an art lover it was a rare treat, i can tell you.
11;Macintosh building walking tour;This was a wonderful 2 1/4 hour walking tour from the School of Art to downtown stopping at historical architectural buildings especially those designed by Macintosh.  Our tour guides, Raheela and Laura were very knowledgable and engaging.
11;Excellent tour!;My wife and I took the GSA tour on Monday, August 3, 2015.  Though it was of course disappointing that the building is presently closed while reconstruction after the 2014 fire takes place, we still got much enjoyment from the tour.  Our guide was a very knowledgeable printmaking student who explained well the many subtle features that Mackintosh had designed into the building.  We enjoyed the exterior tour and were helped to realize how revolutionary (and controversial) the building's design was in its day.  The visit to a room in the new art building across the street to see CRM furniture was a treat.  Our guide also helped us to appreciate how the new Steven Holl-designed building complements the older building.  All in all, this was an excellent tour, and we intend to return when the building has been restored to its former glory.
11;Saddest sight in Scotland;Twice incinerated this Architectural Gem, like Notre Dame, remains sunk in a sea of scaffolding. However unlike the latter there’s no visual evidence of progress.<br>The extended section of the Art School opposite is an eyesore and totally destroys the context which informed MacIntosh’s original design.  Like the adjacent rapidly deteriorating’70’s architecture building, it should never have been built, much less extended. Hopefully in the not to distant future these buildings will be demolished and context, as well as function will inform their replacement and compliment, if not rival McIntosh’s masterpiece.
11;They need to improve their tours;Based on our experience, we agree with the reviews that cite problems with the tours.<br><br>Our tour guide couldn't have been sweeter or more enthusiastic. But this is not what is called for here.<br><br>The art school is a significant building for modern architecture, and one needs a guide who can say more than "This is one of my favorite rooms" or, when pointing out a room suspended over a void: "I'd be afraid to go there!" She needs to be able to comment knowledgeably on features such as the use of steel beam construction, of highly polished concrete, of central heating and air conditioning, of electric lighting.<br><br>Similarly for the aesthetics: it's not enough to know that this is a bird and that is a bug, this is a flower and that is a tree. There was a revolution in decorative art taking place at the time: what were the trends, what influenced Mackintosh, what was the impact of his work?<br><br>The guide mentioned several times that we were touring a working art school, but we got little sense of the intellectual life of the school, either as it was intended by Mackintosh or as it is lived today. Furthermore, the tour did not bring us into any of the studios or into the lecture hall -- the principal spaces built for the students in which to learn. This might be understandable in term time, but during the summer? <br><br>Our recommendation to the Glasgow School of Art is to model their tours on those of the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California: have retired architects conduct the tours (or at least give visitors the option of different types of tours, including architect-guided tours), and at least provide a glimpse into the principal working areas of the building. If the school continues student-guided tours, then it should at least make sure that the tours give the impression that the students have learned the important skill of critical thinking about art and architecture while at the school.
11;A real Mackintosh Treasure;I am an interior designer so, going to the Glasgow School of Art was a real must for me. However, you don't have to be in the design field to appreciate the Glasgow School of Art, the architecture, furniture samples, guided tour and art galleries displaying current students work are interesting and informative. Going on the guided tour is a must and is the only way to view the school. The tours are guided by current students who give you insight into the creation and workings of the school. You go through several rooms and corridors. All the rooms are furnished with real Mackintosh furniture and a book storage room has been transformed into a display of Mackintosh's furniture (from the school and other installations) and several examples of his and his wife's art. At the end of the tour you are able to visit the galleries at your leisure. This is a must see when in Glasgow! Don't forget to visit the gift shop too, filled with Mackintosh related keepsakes and momentos.
11;You dont have to be an art expert to love this place;We went to find out about Charles Rennie Macintosh and his work and influence in Glasgow. we took a tour with a guide which I would thoroughly recommend. Our guide Laura L was friendly, funny and very knowledgeable. Absolutely worth a visit!!
11;walking tour;Tour guides are all students who have a great deal of knowledge of MacInchtosh Rennie, as they studied in his building. Although we could not enter, because of the previous damage, they had great stories to tell and informed all visitors about the history of the building, and made it fun at the same time. The weather was bad, it was raining at the time,but I didn't mind. brollies were supplied. Their enthusiasm was contagious, the furniture divine and the new build spectacular. Highly Reccommended!
11;Great 20th C architecture site and excellent tour;Very important site for those interested in 20th C European/North American architecture -- or the history of Scotland. Our tour guide (John) is a graduate of the School and gave us deep details on the Mackintosh buliding, the architect's career and life, as well as the recent buliding across from the Mackintosh building. Please bear in mind, however, that the Mackintosh building is not currently open due to repairs underway, so the tour of this building is of the exterior only -- nonetheless, highly worthwhile in my view.
11;Cheap and cheerful;Food reasonable if you are on a budget.  I didn't particularly enjoy the food I ordered so won't be eating there again but can see the appeal if you are a student on a budget

12;Imposing building;We visited the Royal Scottish Academy in March, just before lockdown.  It faces directly on to Princes Street and is quite an imposing building with huge pillars.  We did not find much here to interest us as we did not want to pay an entrance fee for the main exhibition.  We much preferred the Scottish National Gallery which is the building just behind the RSA.
12;A Georgian gallery of art;Nice modern and contemporary art exhibition. Spectacular architecture of the Greek-style building. Beautiful historical pieces.
12;Royal Scottish Academy;This is a good place for a rainy day. We spend 2 hours while it rained and learned alot about art, well worth seeing.
12;Well presented and very informative;I visited the RSA exhibition at the Mound in January 2014.  Paintings by RSA members were beautifully presented and available for sale.  I thoroughly enjoyed my afternoon viewing the high standard of work shared by local artists. The highlight for me was the room dedicated to architectural design in Scotland.  The information about the VandA planned for Dundee as well as the proposed plans for the Forth Rail Bridge were clearly explained and very exciting.  I can''t wait to see the completed projects!
12;Nope... just don't get it !;I expect that the luvy's will think that this place is fantastic, but I just don't get it at all.<br>£20 odd grand for a load of old scrap iron on the floor ?<br>£60 for a bit of fluff ?<br><br>I'm not daft and I know some of this "exhibition" is designed to provoke reaction, but a lot of the stuff in here is just tat looking for a mug to buy it.<br><br>It's free and kills an hour out of the rain, but there are far better things to do with your time in this fabulous city.
12;Fantastic Gallery in Princes Street Gardens;The Gallery is on Princes Street, very close to Waverley Station.<br>It consists of two buildings. The one on Princes Street seemed to house the big headline exhibitions, like the Impressionist Gardens when I was there. I must admit that for £12 I had to give that one a miss. I had a look at the free exhibition by contemporary artists which was great, but quite small.<br>This gallery is though connected to the building in the back. The entrance to this building is free. This part houses the very impressive portrait gallery. My favourite were three ghost-like oncologists. You would not expect to see modern portraits as well, so I was very pleasantly surprised. There were some fantastic well-known renaissance, impressionist, etc. masterpieces as well. I am by no means an expert, but recognised several paintings. There was also a McTaggart exhibition when I was there. I wish I had more time. You could easily spend half a day, a day there.<br>The building consists of about 4 floors, but they are all accessible by lift. There is a cafe and a gift shop.<br>A small observation: All the security staff had trousers with check pattern.
12;Great building;If honest I prefer the architecture of the building far more than its contents. Can appreciate some of the artwork on display.
12;If you Love Art...;Then you must go here.  Harbinger of new work and modern thinking.  Changing exhibitions.  Currently Bridget Riley exhibition.
12;Bridget Riley;This is a wonderful exhibition of a great artist. Whether monochrome, colour, painting or sculpture, everything delights. And it's fascinating to see her working drawings.
12;Walk of wonder;We visit the Academy probably once a year for an exhibition and also to remind ourselves of the permanent collection and see old favourites - like William McTaggart. Monet, John Singer Sargent and the Rev. Robert Walker skating on the loch.<br><br>Then have a great lunch in the Scottish Cafe and Restaurant!
13;A wee piece of heaven;The building is a reconstruction of the old Bishop's palace.  It's one of the few museums in Europe dedicated to multi- faiths and re-opened only a few weeks ago <br>    Start on the top floor for wonderful views of the Cathedral and Necropolis.<br> The galleries are full of interesting objects like the Nigerian Ancestry Screen and a vibrant Shiva figure. The first class stained glass collection comes from churches all over Glasgow.<br>You cannot miss the most recent acquisition - Peter Howson's huge painting 'The Massacre at Sbrenica' . This is a stark reminder of the danger that religious intolerance can bring.<br>  On a sunny day, visit the Zen Garden.<br>The cafe is still closed but the helpful staff pointed out another close to the Infirmary.<br>   Combine this with a Cathedral visit for a great morning or afternoon excursion.
13;Interesting Displays on the Rites of Passage;I have always been interested in the different religions so I found this little museum engaging. They did a great job with the displays and artifacts to illustrate how different belief systems regulate ceremonies for birth, marriage, death and other lifetime rituals. It is well worth a visit if you are curious about rites of passage! (We had a short time here on a cruise ship for the day (docked in Greenock) - we did it on our own and fit in the Necropolis, Glasgow Cathedral, St Mungo Museum of Religious Life and Art, Provand's Lordship, the HOHO bus, lunch at George Square and Rick Steves "Glasgow Walk" from his book.)
13;Nice experience;T hi anus a great thing to do in Glasgow. Located near the University and the Royal Infirmary. It is steeped i. History and blends great learning with beautiful build. St Mu hi cathedral is also worthy of visiting
13;Great building, interesting inside;To be fair, we only popped in here because we were cold after visiting the cathedral and the Necropolis. It was lovely and warm inside but also had lots to see.<br>We enjoyed getting more information on the cathedral and Necropolis from the viewing window up on the top floor. There’s also some interesting information regarding the range of religions in Scotland. We didn’t have enough time to fully view the lower floors. They even have the first Zen garden in Britain, but don’t expect to see anything like you would in Japan. <br>
13;Not just for people of faith;Very friendly, welcoming staff. Loved the fact that the information on the religions of the world are all mixed together. Not necessary to have a faith to enjoy this museum. Beautifully put together to inform people. 3 floors. Give yourself an hour to enjoy this museum......and don't forget to leave a fiver if you can afford it.
13;Brilliant museum that makes an important contribution;This is a great museum full of interesting and easily-digested information about art and life of different religions. I think I learnt more about world religion in one visit than I have in the rest of my life. It's also just the right size to get around in just over an hour.<br>
13;Popped in before heading to the Cathedral;We stumbled upon this place on our way to the Glasgow Cathedral and Necropolis.  Cute little museum with interesting art religious exhibits.
13;A day in Glasgow, covering things in your own city;So interesting, years since I'd visited and loved it.Very multicultural, enjoyed all the religious information
13;ANY PORT IN A STORM;The cafe at this museum provides OK looking food, but it seldom has much flavour. Best bet is the panini which is usually well toasted. The little pot of coleslaw which comes with it is rather acidic. Very little choice of eateries around Cathedral Square in Glasgow. A walk up the High Street towards the Royal Infirmary will take you to a boutique hotel and cafe with proper home-made food located in the old Infirmary Pharmacy.
13;Great comparison of all modern (and some ancient) religions;This right beside the Glasgow Cathedral and the Necropolis so easy to get to. It is also one if the many free museums in Glasgow. I have read a lot about the various religions and this was a excellent recap and unbiased comparison. I would call this both entertaining and educational.  Great displays with lots of explanatory captions.
14;An impressive expereience;Today was "Visit Your Mosque Day", so I took the opportunity and I'm glad I did. I was given a warm welcome, with a brief overview of Islam by a friendly and informative guide. The building itself is simple but interesting, but for me the big benefit was hearing about the beliefs and practices of Islam from someone involved in the religion. So much that we hear about Islam in the media is hostile. it's really valuable to get even just a brief insight from those who practice it.
14;Well worth visiting.;I visited the Mosque with friends as it was participating in Doors Open Day.<br>Most impressed by the Mosque building. Apart from the stunning dome It was simple and elegant.<br>We were made to feel very welcome and had a fascinating, informative and entertaining tour. Many thanks to our delightful guide.<br>Not being a Muslim I now have a better understanding of that faith.....which can only be a good thing.<br>Highly recommend a visit.
14;Open doors day.;Visited this weekend, given a tour by a very engaging and informative guide, and learned a lot about Islam. Thankyou for the opportunity to visit.
14;Iconic Building;Great building and a clear symbol of Islam's integration into Glasgow' culture.   Not too far from the city centre.
14;Very clean;This place is very clean with a handy car park. Folk are friendly and they run community groups inside. I was shown around by a friend and found the place to be very peaceful.
14;Very big and beautiful on the inside;The mosque is very big, and, there is a prayer room for men downstairs, and a prayer room for women upstairs. Also, there's even a vending machine with great snacks inside! Overall, I love this mosque, and I would definitely recommend it if you are living in or are touring Glasgow.
14;Forth Valley University of the third age;Our volunteer guide identified himself as a senior school teacher. His grandfather had come to the UK in the 1950s and was one of the founding members of the Central Mosque. Our guides usual tours are for school children, but he hoped that he would not talk down to us. Well we can confirm that he did not. His presentation was beautifully crafted. He held our attention and gave us a splendid varied and interesting tour. The mind setting requirements of preparation for pray were explained. We watched as he explained the washing process. We were taken into the main place of worship and made to feel at home. Stories and explanations were followed by questions and some enlightening and engaging answers. There was fortunately time in our tight schedule for a quick visit to the balcony where unfortunately we interrupted a lady at pray. She seemed to enjoy, as we did, our guide as he continued to enthral us with yet more learned as well as down to earth thoughts. None of us wanted to leave! A delightfully informative and enlightening experience. Many many thanks on behalf of Forth Valley U3A.
14;Nice and welcoming;nice and welcoming Mosque big in size as well, It a good idea to go to the main office and ask for someone to help u get a guided tour. Muslims are welcomed to perform thier prayers/salat, alos has a nice wee shop to allow you to purchase Arabic books and other things as well.
14;Lovely mosque;A lovely mosque, with a lovely diamond glass doom on top, which is visible from a distance . Well worth a look.
14;beautifully located ,peaceful place to pray.;Located at the center of city, tea / coffee vending machine available. Halal restaurants nearby. Friendly people around .Well maintained Toilets.

15;Best pakora!;We were in Glasgow just for the day and found ourselves with a couple of hours to spare before heading back to the airport. I hadn't been to the Ashoka for decades but remembered it from my student days as one of the best curry houses in Glasgow. My wife had never been there and I had promised her a fantastic experience. We were not disappointed! The smell outside was delicious and inside even better! We were warmly greeted and shown to our table by our server Diksh. We explained that we were in a bit of a rush and she assured us that we would have plenty of time to eat before we headed to the airport. We decided on mixed pakoras to start - mix of vegetable, chicken and haggis. All I can say is that they were fantastic!! I particularly liked the vegetable pakora together with the traditional red sauce and I hadn't had anything this good since my student days. For mains, we had Bengali King Prawn and Chicken Rogan Josh with some rice. Needless to say, both were amazing! I don't think it would have mattered what we had ordered as everything we saw on other people's plates also looked amazing and smelled wonderful. Highly recommended (and good value for money). And our server Diksh was so friendly and welcoming.
15;Ashoka - just like my student days- great;Food was great and very good value. Server Kiran efficient and friendly . Was a student at Glasgow uni - one of my all time favourite venues . Still very good
15;Yum!;Had a wonderful night! Served by Diksh - they are awesome :) such friendly service and delicious food! Plus, soooo many vegan options! Thank you! 🤘
15;Excellent vegan selection and amazing staff!;This is the best Indian restaurant. The restaurant in itself is very pretty and cosy, and the staff is so kind, efficient and helpful. The menu is really diverse and there is an incredible vegan/veggie selection. Everything was ready really fast and was delicious.
15;Great meal!;Great food, fantastic service from Kirtika and nice atmosphere too. We will definitely be back to try some other dishes!
15;Beautiful place and service;Great food and even better service, Diksh was our server and she was lovely! Had a lovely evening and will definitely be visiting again
15;Great;Amazing place in Ashton lane. Diksh was so lovely and provided us with amazing service. Great food and it came out very fast as well. Will be back
15;Excellent food and service;Trip down memory lane as I experienced my first ever curry here in 1980. Food as good as ever! Service excellent
15;Not disappointed;Had a beautiful meal in The Ashoka last week, first time in a while and we were not disappointed. The Lamb Karahi was delicious and the Kerela Chilli Chicken lovely, a little too sweet for me but that’s just personal taste. Kirtika was our server and was brilliant. Looking forward to returning but will definitely book well in advance as it’s extremely busy
15;Recommended to me by locals and I see why;Delicious!! Super authentic food and a really cute vibe at the restaurant. Really recommend the creamy masala with king prawns and the Rogan Josh with paneer (recommended by our waitress, Diksh, and she nailed it!)
16;Busy Street in Central Glasgow;This street is a hive of activity from shoppers, business people to street performers. There are plenty of shops, restaurants and  attractions along the street. It has a great vibe and just watching the world go by is also a pleasant pastime here. Something for everyone.
16;Busy, Buzzy, Bustling Buchanan Street.;This is the main pedestrianised shopping street in Glasgow, and whatever the weather it’s got a lively vibe. It’s also the most successful U.K. high street outside of London. The 19th century architecture is striking , so don’t just focus on the restaurants, shops and speciality stores here ( many which are boutique and high-end)  - remember to look up at the skyline. This street’s also popular with buskers, so often you get entertained whilst shopping. Princes Square is very elegant, but I like this building beside it that houses the Nespresso Boutique.
16;Great shopping street;Buchanan Street is one of Glasgow's main commercial thoroughfares. On thi one of the busiest and lively street to wonder around in the Glasgow City, can find most of the trendy stores and restaurants here.  It forms the central stretch of Glasgow's famous shopping district with a generally more upmarket range of shops than the neighbouring streets: Argyle Street, and Sauchiehall Street. Here you can find Argyll Arcade, Princes Square mall, Gallery of Modern Art, Buchanan Galleries , Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.  Buchanan Street is now entirely pedestrianised, but the streets that cross it , like St. Vincent Street, George Street and Bath Street are not. This street has a great atmosphere. Street artists are also here ready for you. If  you are not sure where to walk here is the best starting point.
16;Another Shopping Street;Buchanan street is another street of shops and walking.  If you start at the "top" of Souichihall (off Goodblythe), then you can walk (and shop) all the way to Buchanan Street.   The two streets together make an "L" with Buchanan being the horizontal part of the L.  There is a modern indoor mall where the two streets meet.   Buchanan street seemed to have more street performers on it, but as other reviewers have mentioned, it is full of shops and people.    It is a nice place to take a relaxing stroll.
16;Glasgow's Shopping Runway;Named after Andrew Buchanan, a wealthy tobacco Lord, Buchanan Street has gained a well-deserved reputation as THE major shopping district in Glasgow. It is generally considered to be more “upmarket” in comparison to its fellow “Golden Z” streets, Sauchiehall and Argyle – something that I think is quite apt given the history behind the name “Buchanan” within the context of this street. In short, if you’re here to do some shopping, be sure to have plenty of cash or credit cards on you!<br><br>As I wandered in and around Buchanan Street, I couldn’t help but draw comparisons to a street closer to home: Robson Street in Vancouver. Like Buchanan, Robson Street is renowned for its shopping. It is also considered to be rather high end. In fact, practically all of the independent shops on Robson have gone the way of the dodo due to egregiously high rents. As such, you tend to see a lot of chain and big brand name stores – shops you tend to see everywhere, regardless of location. Indeed, that’s exactly what I thought as I ambled about Buchanan Street. While I did spy a couple of UK-based retailers, a lot of what I came across was “much of the same.” You know, stores like Apple, Nike, Diesel, Urban Outfitters, Hugo Boss, Gucci, and Lego . . . I could go on but you get the point. It’s globalization at its finest – a sort of cultural sameness and homogenized shopping. How lame.<br><br>Interestingly, since 1999, Buchanan Street has been repaved in high quality granite. The symbolism here cannot be missed. In order to survive and thrive, the shops have to be doing well because I guarantee the rents aren’t cheap (in fact, a quick Google check reveals that some rents on the street are as much as £250 per square foot!). That’s yet another interesting point of comparison with Robson Street.<br><br>I have a hard time with Buchanan Street. On the one hand, it is Glasgow’s shopping mecca. on the other hand, it kind of loses its aura for me because nothing much beyond some of the architecture stands out. The physical structures of the storefronts highlight this place and space, but the actual stores themselves – Prada for all – represent bland uniformity.
16;Effectively the "main street" in the city centre;Stretching from Sauchiehall Street down to St Enoch Square, Buchanan Street is the city's main pedestrian boulevard. <br><br>It is probably the city’s best shopping area and is decidedly smarter and more upmarket than the neighbouring Argyle Street, and Sauchiehall Street. There is a very good range of quality shops as well as cafes, pubs and restaurants.
16;Big g glasgow;This area of glasgow is the nicest in the city centre it has loads of great shops in what is a pedestrian area so no traffic to worry about theres plenty of nice places to eat and drink some in little side lanes .the shopping arcade just of the street is the argyle arcade and a great old place its full of jewellery shops .princess sq is another gem to visit full of shops and eateries . The main shop is house of fraser its a grand old building .this is an honest review for anyone visiting glasgow even although i live in glasgow
16;So lively Buchanan;I believe, if you are looking for London's busy and colourful vibe in Scotland, you will definitely find it at Buchanan street, Glasgow. So busy, so lively and so many crowds. I love the atmosphere- sounds, music, shops, crowds etc.
16;Shopping Heaven;Retail therapy quenched here. Wide paved street with a wide range of shops, restaurants bars and cafe's. All the designer boutiques are within a stone throw if that's your thing and for those who prefer Primark you'll find that too. something for everyone.
16;The best shopping experience!;Whether you are seriously shopping or just browsing you can do no better than come to Buchanan St. Glasgow. <br>Architecturally it is a pleasure. Visit the wonderful Princes Square with tasteful shops.. Kate Spade, Whistles to name a few. Even has an Everyman Cinema. Also, cafes, bistros. A joy. <br>Back in Buchanan St. there are superb shops, restaurants( incl. The Ivy) .. Street cafes, buskers add to atmosphere. <br>Off Buchanan  St.you can visit The Lighthouse Museum... <br>So much more, just visit. <br>Suits all, couples, families, business men/women. Solo..

17;What a collection. Amazing. X;My husband and I really enjoyed our visit here. The entrance hall is not laid out particularly well as you have to walk past toilets and a badly thought out cafe before you even get to the actual reception. Signage seemed almost non existent and we were a little confused where to go initially once past reception. That aside, we really enjoyed our visit to see all the vast collection in what we thought was a well hought out building to house the collection. The cafe served standard quality food at standard prices for these days. The cafe was ridiculously busy when we attended but the staff were doing their best to keep on top of their workload. There is also a very well stocked museum shop however the prices on the products on sale was extortionate in my opinion.
17;Glad to be back;So much to see in this lovely building   Such a variety  of ancient  more modern.    The East Gallery is wonderful, with the trees outside .   I love the Nottingham Alabasters and the Iznik ceramics.  I almost forgot Manets Women drinking Beer  <br>I bought a Souvenir Guide    Beautifully produced and a very reasonable price for an art book <br>Thank you to Glasgow Museums !
17;Wonderful, but tad overwhelming;Something of a mixed experience. There are certainly some wonderful exhibits and pieces on display, and the light from the huge windows really helped the space to feel light and spacious even though it was very busy. I did however find it overwhelming. There was so much to see it was hard to know where to start or what there was. There didn't seem an intuitive route or thread to guide you around. We ended up kinda wandering and then felt we couldn't take any more in so went and got a cuppa in the restaurant. Probably needs more than one visit to really appreciate it properly. I think if I went again I'd enjoy it more.<br>It was great there were plenty of comfy chairs about so didn't have to stand the whole time. <br>The main problem was getting there and back. It's in a massive park. Walking is an issue for me but even paying for a taxi was quite stressful as signs at the entrance to the park stated no vehicular access (but there was). The shuttle bus is a brilliant facility but pollokshaws west station is not accessible without stairs, so I hope this can perhaps be expanded with other pick up and drop off points. Signs so it's clear where the shuttle bus stops would also help people to know it exists and increase accessibility. I'd go again but with a friend who was driving in case of any problems!
17;Restaurant - avoid!!;My review is actually for the restaurant NOT the actual Collection which is most interesting and remarkable. <br>Today we visited The Burrell Collection principally to meet a friend for lunch in the restaurant. However beware.. it is most disappointing and over priced with an incredibly rude and unhelpful manager who obviously doesn’t appreciate customer service! <br>On entering the restaurant you choose a table, review the paper menu on the table and then queue to place your order. This I did. Chose from the section entitled Flat Breads, and proceeded to queue for well over 10 minutes to place my order. On reaching the till point I was then informed there were no flat breads but I could chose a sandwich with a different filling! Really didn’t fancy that so we ended up having leek and potato soup… not a exactly adventurous! The soup is then delivered to the table. It was ok but certainly nothing special ( small portion) and the bread was pretty hard. <br>I asked the waitress what the problem was with the flatbread and was told they had been out of it for over a month! So why was it still on the menu- showing 3 different fillings and yet not available?! I asked to speak to the manager. The waitress returned to say the manager was busy and if I wished to speak to her then I should go to the serving area?! 🤷‍♀️… the customer having to seek out the manager. However I did so.. she was defensive!   and when I asked why food which was unavailable for over a month was displayed on a menu she said it would take a lot of reprinted menus! Surely a line through unavailable items would suffice. When I asked why she was unable to come and speak to me she said it was a busy time and she unable to leave what she was doing!! <br>Honestly.. customer service NON existent! <br>A most disappointing restaurant visit - avoid unless you really have to!
17;Good Day Out;Finally it is open again, with many more objects on view.<br>I found the spaces confused and often you go from dim lighting to sun blasted, good luck if you want to do a circuit.<br>Half the cafe/restaurant has no sun shade, but large portions of food are delivered quickly to your table number.<br>We arrived by bus and that was not good, way better is the train from/to Central station (2 stops) via Pollockshaws West station. If you wait outside the Pollock park electric bus will take you in to the museum and on to Pollock House (National Trust of Scotland).<br>Warning the Highland Cattle in the park look docile but have massive fast moving horns!
17;Free guided tour;Visited the Burrell Collection for the fist time, and we were very lucky to arrive just in time for a free guided tour. Our guide was Morna, and she was great... very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the exhibits, and it really enhanced our visit experience
17;Fabulous free museum in a wildlife setting;Easy to find near several motorway junctions south of Glasgow and the M77. Generous parking right in front of it, use the Burrell Collection satnav address. Pay and display, credit cards accepted. Modern new building displaying an eclectic mix of wonderful and amazing artifacts from the ancient to the modern through a wide spectrum of cultures and religions. Expect to spend at least 3 hours. Great cafeteria, if expensive. Interactive displays for children. Good gift shop. Friendly staff. The layout is inventive but the exit is sometimes difficult to find.Thoroughly recommend it. And it’s free!
17;A must-visit in Glasgow;I visited The Burrell Collection after a recommendation from a friend, having never previously heard of it despite living in Glasgow. As soon as I arrived I was completely blown away. Situated in a vast, beautiful quiet park, The Burrell Collection makes you completely forget you are in a city. It houses a fascinating collection of pieces from all over the world in a range of difference mediums - sculptures, paintings, tapestries, etc. There are many interactive exhibits throughout the museum which are fun for all ages. Informative videos about the making of or history of the object are projected on the walls alongside the exhibits which is a lovely touch. The building itself is a work of art, which only adds to the viewing experience. Even the gift shop is fantastic - beautiful replicas for astonishingly low prices. I could not recommend The Burrell Collection enough, I will definitely be back!
17;Ecletic collection;One couple's collection and gift to Glasgow. This is the world art collection created by the Burrells. Fascinating to see items from several countries and centuries and some good interactives exhibits. The building is also lovely. We got there by train to Pollokshaws West and then walked through the country park. There is an electric shuttlebus to take you from the park entrance to the museum or a car park available. There are also bus stops on the edge of the park.
17;Guided tour by Morna;Although I have visited The Burrell several times, this was my first experience of a guided tour. What a difference it makes.<br>Although I have appreciated the beauty of the exhibits, I had no idea just how rare many of them are. This made the art even more priceless for me.<br>This was not a quick scoot round, but a surprisingly in depth presentation given by someone clearly in love with these wonderful pieces of art. <br>I particularly loved snippets about the artists lives at the time of their painting .<br>And learning what Burrell paid for his collection was an eye opener.<br>Hearing what overseas art experts had visited to view also, gives you a warm feeling....of pride?<br>I will be back soon for another tour with my husband who is a staunch Glaswegian - there will be no living with him!

18;Birthday Tour at Celtic Park;We were on the 6-7pm tour at Celtic Park on 26th November where our tour guide was John. Honestly John you are amazing your knowledge of the clubs history and they way you spoke about it just made everything amazing. This tour was booked for my son Kais birthday and John was incredible with him to where he let him lead out our tour group and down the tunnel to Youll never walk alone 🍀 it gave me goosebumps 💚 I can’t fault the tour one bit apart from it only being an hour as didn’t want it to end 😂 even my son wanted to stay in their dressing room and wait ti see him favourite Kyogo 😂
18;Celtic Park Tour;My nephew and I attended the  Celtic Park Tour on Friday 1st July and it fantastic.<br>The tour guide was an absolute star not only with his detailed knowledge of Celtic's history and achievements, but he engaged brilliantly with us all (quote a big group, around 25 of us)  with lots of good humour and quips. Nothing was too much for him, including taking photos.<br>The name of the tour guide was Martin Scanlon - thank you Martin!<br>Walking down the tunnel out to the park with YNWA belting out was a particular highlight.<br>I know a lot about Celtic's wonderful history but there were a couple of wee 'nuggets' that I was unaware of that came to light during Martin's tour.<br>I would thoroughly recommend this for any football fan - not just Celtic fans.<br> <br><br>
18;Friendly, accommodating and knowledgeable staff;Brought my family to a tour at Celtic Park. The staff were very accommodating when we accidentally turned up at the wrong time. The tour guide Phil was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the club. He was also a very funny gentlemen who got to know the tour participants to provide a personal touch. He allowed time for questions and chat with the group. There was a young birthday boy on the tour and Phil made his day special by letting him be first through the tunnel onto the pitch etc. After rhe tour, my family and I stayed at the bar for a drink whilst the rain passed.
18;Celtic Tour;My Family support Celtic we drove up from London for the Tour and to watch a match. We were a little disappointed with the tour, a lot of talking and not alot of things to look at and take in. The tour guide was really good and very knowledgable however over half of the hours tour was standing in the board room talking and im not very good at just standing there listening to be honest.  I feel with all your history you need a interactive museum to show case your history. I have been on the Manchester united tour and they have a wonderful museum included in the tour and i feel Celtic needs something just like this.
18;A true football club with unique history!!;Thanks to Desmond and Martin, two passionate professionals who offered a top notch tour that takes you in time and uncover football history like no other club in Europe, and I've done plenty. The stadium is in good shape, they're unique but I will not uncover the secret on that and honestly a true football club. Next time here I'll bring my son to a game, and guess what we're not even Celtic fans but it's that much worthed!!
18;Oh the days;Dear Diary, where do i begin. Today i had my tour of celtic park, very big, very green, not sure green is my favourite colour,i kept that a secret though, i didn't want the tour guide to know (might think im one of those cow suckers). Green was my favourite colour when i was younger, wish i could go back to the year 2008 when the black eyed peas were big and people actually cared about the X Factor and other terrible TV, things just aren't the same since Harry left one direction. It all started all those years ago when i forgot to take my washing out the tumble dryer and it imploded, i still managed clean the kettle and make a dead class lasagne for tea.<br><br>Great Tour, would go again
18;Great experience;Tour guide was brilliant. Tom Kelly made the tour memorable. Full of information and history all mixed in with love and passion for the club. Made my son feel like he was top of the world as he allowed him to lead the tour out onto the pitch as captain. Would highly recommend to any Celtic fan
18;Must visit;We booked this tour for my sons birthday and enjoyed every minute. Our tour guide Phil is a fanatic and it was easy to tell he took great delight and pride in showing people around. Thanks for a great tour, and we will be back again 😊👍🏻☘️
18;Paradise;My wife an i did this tour. Neither of us are actually<br>Celtic fans.  But i must say our Guide Lorraine was very knowledgeable. And i get it now. The celtic fans their History an their compassion for others its more than just “Fitba”. 10/10 highly recommend. Magic
18;Visit Paradise for a wonderful sporting occasion;Firstly I'm a biased reviewer as I've been a season ticket holder for a great many years, Every time I go to a match I get a shiver down my back. If its a Champions League game or Europa League game, just before the game kicks off, the music plays the UEFA  anthem and the new lighting show beams around the ground. The fans are renowned around the world for their friendliness and banter.

19;an excellent first time experience for someone in a wheelchair;i attended concert on wednesday 20th april 2022. i phoned the accessibility dept. to explain that after a stroke i would be  unable to take my original seat. scott explained he would notify box office and not to worry. on arrival a steward lead me to the box office , where they very quickly sorted my seats so that i could stay in my wheelchair. a very nice steward stayed with me while i waited for my son to arrive. we were directed to our seats very efficiently
19;Jimmy Carr gig.;My wife and I went to see Jimmy Carr. The show was excellent. The venue was pretty well organised despite the looming covid 19 pandemic. I think the only down side was that the bars was on the ground floor and unfortunately we were in the nose bleeds, there were small bars on each floor but the ones I seen was closed. Great night though.
19;Futuristic venue;Went to see George Thorogood and the Destroyer.....There is a multi-story car park for the SEC, watch for the sign painted on the road. Why is the car park in front of the building barricaded off, be easier to park there? It is an interesting building, like a small metal version of the Sydney Opera House. Inside it is quite soulless in an almost futuristic way. 2 bars, (one was closed). Seating, sound and view was good. Able to get out of the auditorum and car park easily
19;Organisation was terrible;Our email said “collect tickets at venue” for Paw Patrol Live so my excited 3yo and I arrived at the venue at doors open time, queued for 40 minutes in the rain while the doors were not, in fact, open, and arrived at the front of the queue to be told that we actually had to collect tickets from the box office in a separate building. We went to the separate building and saw that there was one sign, facing the railway bridge, about the box office collection. Anyone arriving from any other direction could not have known. The box office queue was full of annoyed parents like me, with kids in tow. We then had to join the back of the queue again, in the rain.<br><br>It had been advertised that prams could be brought to the venue, and with it being an event for toddlers and young children, many parents had. However, there was nowhere to leave prams! They ended up abandoned in doorways and at the bottoms of escalators. Surely a venue hosting an event for thousands of young children cannot be surprised and ill-prepared when thousands of young children show up?!<br><br>Fortunately none of this spoiled the actual show for my daughter who loved seeing her favourite pups on stage and seemed blissfully unaware of her mother’s nerves being in tatters!
19;No room for dancing at Jools.....;Jools Holland , Stalls, Row H. Stopped by an aggressive Usher lady when I was walking towards group of dancers in front of stage. Told I wasn't allowed to go up to dance. Ruined the atmosphere for me for the rest of gig. Front rows having a whale of a time up dancing stage front while the rest of us are disciplined and restricted to standing dancing on the spot within our seat area. Not good or fair. Won't go again.
19;I have no words.;The actual venue was fine.  The show, Haters Roast Ru Paul was absolutely appalling.  Not funny at all, American humour is the pits.  It was so bad people walked out.  Even the act was asking people to laugh.  I get the idea is to  character assassinate each other.  It was racist, anti semitic, laughing at the death of Princess Diana, laughing at what happened in Auschwitz.   The c u next Tuesday word constant! Shouting it out all through the act.  Now I can take a joke as good as the next person, however this crossed the line.  Absolutely never again! I’ve been to several Ru Paul shows and had a fantastic night! But this?  Disgusting!
19;Dolls show;1st time here in ages found  staff not so helpful and glum especially girl on info desk didn't look intrested. Main auditorium was ok clear view and sound OK but prefer hydro
19;Help;Very concerned about visiting the Armadillo for Swan Lake tomorrow night with an elderly friend with walking difficulties and heart problem but not regarded as 'disabled' the walk from multi storey car park will not be possible. Can anyone advise me please
19;Bill Bailey concert;The concert was great and a sell out however the upstairs bar was not open and the two that were open were painfully slow , so much so my partner missed the first 5minutes of the 2nd half - good venue and close to city centre but really need to look at the demand inside for drinks and snacks
19;Harry Styles;This venue is great. Fully seated, great stage views, excellent acoustics. <br><br>Very easy to get to, rail links, bus stop nearby, fully served taxi rank.<br><br>Staff very friendly and helpful. Was surprised at the seeming lack of security checks however, despite being told to bring photo ID, I wasn't asked for it. <br><br>100% would attend a show here again.
19;Connor mcgregor;I missed the first half of Connor McGregor coming on as I waited an hour to be served at the top bar! Only 2 servers and cash only was an absolute joke to make it worse it was absolutely boiling waiting in the queue! Surely this place would have known it was going to busy busy with Connor McGregor and would have made sure they had more than enough staff 😤
19;Miranda Lambert in Glasgow;The smaller of the Exhibition Centre venues, the Clyde Auditorium (more commonly known as the Armadillo because of the architecture) seats around 3000 over three tiered levels - stalls, circle and gallery.  These levels are sub-divided into front and rear sections.<br><br>It’s a modern looking building inside and out and shares parking facilities with the other venues on the large site.<br><br>Bar facilities inside are functional - there is no seating and wine for example is sold in a sealed plastic “glass” at £6.50/£7.00, the same price we paid for a large (250ml) real glass of wine across the way at the SEC’s Clydebuilt bar which does have seating (some of it not very comfortable…think metal tractor seat).   Clydebuilt also sells food but there are a host of better places within walking distance.<br><br>Seating in the arena was very comfortable - decent leg and elbow room in the stalls based on our most recent experience.  As is common at many concerts we didn’t have a lot of time to enjoy them since as soon as the main act appeared people were on their feet for the entire show.   We had seats X26 and 27, four rows from the back of the Rear Stalls and central to the stage so the view was good although a bit distant.  The carpet was a bit sticky probably with spilt drinks which you are permitted to take into the arena provided they’ve been bought there!<br><br>We found the sound quality was good - the support act was Ward Thomas who were on for a brief 30 minute set, followed by Miranda Lambert who was accompanied by eight musicians in her band.  Some of the more rousing numbers were a bit distorted sound-wise but in quieter moments the vocals were excellent.   The spot lighting of Ms Lambert was extreme and she often appeared as a white glow on stage but that may be down to her own crew.   Miranda controversially didn’t play an encore at this event for reasons unknown (she did mention at one point that she expected the audience to be more wild) but we enjoyed it nonetheless and were only “robbed” of three songs she included in her set everywhere else on the tour.<br><br>The venue website provides approximate timings for the acts a day or two before the event which helps plan the night e.g. for this event the doors opened at 6.30pm, the support act appeared at 8.00pm and the main act at 9.00pm until around 10.20pm.<br><br>There is a good train link from Exhibition station, a short covered walk from the venue, to Glasgow City Centre.  We stayed overnight on this occasion at the fairly new Premier Inn Pacific Quay which is a few minutes walk across the Bell’s Bridge and has it’s own secure car park.  It was ideal for this venue.<br><br>From this and past experience of attending a concert at the Armadillo I’d try for seats in the front stalls if available, failing which possibly the front circle.  The gallery is distant and there are no large screens so take binoculars if you want to see the act up close.

20;Check Your Car Parking Options!;This is easily one of the best entertainment venues in Glasgow. However, as this was only my second visit since the onset of the COVID pandemic and there was the Glasgow Football Derby and a Kevin Bridges event in the City Centre on the same night as our Jane McDonald concert, I opted to drive in rather than risk public transport. Previously, on Concert Nights, Buchanan Galleries Car Park extended its opening hours for visitors to the Royal Concert Hall. However this is no longer the case as I discovered to my horror when I returned to get my car at 9:50pm only to discover that the car park had closed at 9pm! This resulted in a £16 taxi fare home and a further trip into the City Centre today to retrieve said car. Felt it necessary to point this out as The Concert Hall website still advises "Follow the signs for Buchanan Galleries Shopping Centre." but don't be fooled into thinking you can park when you get there! Apparently, that all changed 3 years ago. <br>The venue itself is excellent in terms of the variety of entertainment, seating arrangements (the seats are suitably staggered so you don't have someone else's head in your way when trying to see the performance) and the quality of the sound. Very long bar queues but maybe that's just jealousy on my part as I had thought I would be driving home!
20;A geat venu;This was our first outing to a big event and felt very safe it seemed that there was more staff on than usual.  Did not have to show our covid passport or vaccination certificate because masks had to be worn during the performance however it was about 50% with masks on when the lights went down.<br><br>Staff very friendly and helpful, they even moved some people because they could not see the stage because of a bank of speakers.<br><br>Show was excellent Cliff Richard’s The Great 80 Tour.<br><br>A great venue for any show.
20;THE ELVIS YEARS - MARIO KOMBOU;We attended the Elvis Years show on Friday evening.  On arrival at the venue we were greeted by lovely staff.  We were a bit early for the show and chatted to a staff member (think his name was Ian) who was very pleasant and helpful to visitors.  We noticed that he got a very abrupt reply from one lady who was attending Celtic Connections when he gave her directions.  It’s not an easy job dealing with the public, so well done on being helpful and polite.  We had really good seats and the show was a brilliant success.  Lovely theatre and so close to hotels, restaurants and public transport.<br><br>I believe that there are going to be refurbishments soon so good luck.
20;Bad usher attitude;Went to see a show last night and the older female usher was a bit over zealous  in asking “only us” to wear our masks ! No announcement was made that said they where mandatory and  very few patrons where wearing them . Asked us to put our masks on and when asked was she going to tell all the people at the back of us too she said “I’m not going away up there “? I said why not if it was her job and she said it’s not my job ??? Unsure why she targeted just us , put on the masks anyway . At the interval I seen and heard her pointing me out to another usher and saying that’s her there ??? Later on I asked her who her supervisor was and she wanted to argue ? This usher made us feel totally uncomfortable with her bizarre behaviour , her supervisor said she would have a word .   Great show , Sorry for your loss, but spoiled with horrible atmosphere this usher created !
20;Fabulous concert!;One of my favourite music venues. I didn’t mind at all being asked to wear a mask throughout the concert - in fact I welcomed it. However, although the “steward” reminded those of us who arrived early to follow Covid policies ( and also to not film the concert) as soon as people arrived who were “in the party mood” they were never challenged about not wearing masks, singing louder than the artist or filming during songs!! Paul Carrack’s is a concert that we look forward to every year but it was spoiled by a lack of “policing” policies …..either that or just don’t have policies!
20;Royal Concert Hall, Glasgow - going downhill.;I attended for A concert but met friends in the cafe area first.  Buidling only opens at 6.30pm and we were served cold soup. Seems the Urns were only switched on at 6.30 too which is concerning since other cooked items were sitting in the buffet trays seemingly from earlier daytime events.  Order of coffees took AGES to be received. Its a nice environment but some rips in seating needing repairs.<br>Gift shop empty and all locked up. <br>Concert was great but lots of empty seats, despite showing almost sold out when I purchased the tickets
20;Brilliant night;Returned to this fine venue for the James Martin tour show and weren't disappointed.<br>We had great seats with fine view and sound.<br>James put on a superb show and entertained us from start to finish as well as making us exceptionally hungry.
20;Sublime performance of Handel's Messiah;Christmas is not Christmas without Handel's Messiah. My wife and I had the pleasure of attending a superb performance of this Oratorio by the RNSO, conducted by Nicholas McGegan.<br>Quite simply, this is the best performance of Messiah I have ever had the privilege to attend. The soloists were stunning and beautifully accompanied by the RNSO on top form. The instruments were perfectly balanced and the acoustics excellent.<br>Our greatest praise is saved for the conductor himself who brought out the very best in Handel's well known score. His judgement of tempo was superlative.<br>Please may he (and the orchestra) return next year? We would love to hear this again.
20;Cliff Richard 80’s Tour.;Have visited on several occasions, love the venue. We were there on 13/10/21 to see Cliff Richard who was fantastic, however we were in block N and a huge speaker was blocking our view. I wish I’d got the name of the member of staff ( might have been supervisor/manager) He was so helpful in getting four of us moved to fabulous seats in the arena. Great venue and great staff. All in all a GREAT night..
20;Celtic Connections - Transatlantic Sessions;Think this is the twelfth year we have attended this concert. The on-line booking system works well and the tickets arrive when they said they would. Seating was comfy and the staff helpful. Drinks at the intermission were sensibly priced. All in all a good experience
20;Illegal Eagles June 2022;I don’t visit the Concert Hall very often and so it’s a nice surprise to see how clean, spacious and well-organised the venue is. My oldest son and I were at The Illegal Eagles (6th time in 10 years) and the show as always was great. Personally I think the atmosphere is better at their old venue of The Kings as its a smaller, more compact venue, but it was still very good. We managed to get seats at the front of the Terrace meaning we were on ground level about 5 rows from the back but with a huge space immediately in front so there was no issue with legroom (we are both over 6ft tall). Great seats and we were also right behind the lighting and sound desks so that was interesting too.
20;Queen Symphonic;Another visit to see the brilliant Glasgow Symphony Orchestra this time with the music of Queen from the cast of We Will Rock You.  Again, a fantastic show which we thoroughly enjoyed.  This is our 3rd visit and we're already looking for options for our next visit.  Brilliant
21;Highly recommend;I agree with other reviewers about what a gem this place is, right in the heart of the city centre. I'm not very knowledgeable about art but found the galleries enjoyable and all the staff members were smiley, which makes a difference when you're in such a space. There was lots of information about the different art on display which helped to contextualise  it and aid appreciation. There was a good variety too, of different media and styles, so would certainly recommend a wander around!<br>There is a lift for all floors and at the top we found some portable stools, which were very much appreciated! It can be hard though to manage carrying a stool, sitting, getting up again... So more permenant seating particularly on the top floor gallery would be welcome.
21;Harassment by an offduty Staff Security and humiliating manager;I was charging my laptop from one of those floor plugs and I had not closed up the lid back into place because I didn't know how. this didn't worry me because my friend and I were seated near the very end of the lib section. After about 10min, a man walked from the other end of the room, went and unplugged my laptop charger and threw it hard on the floor. He said loudly. you cannot charge from here. When I asked him why, he said he said I was not allowed. I asked him why he didn't stop me when I was plugging it in, and we had locked eyes when I was plugging- which he later said he was on phone and hadn't seen me do it.. He said firmly that he was the security. "Sorry love you are not allowed to charge from here love." <br><br>I asked him what his name and he covered his badge and it's that point when I asked for another staff member for the manager.<br><br>Manager was kind enough to come and also see the socket which she apologised that the sockets were not good enough for use and also that they were not covered. She then walked with me back to the reception where the rest of staff members were, and we spent about 15minutes at the least resolving the issue. <br><br>This was humiliating because after my friend came to give his part of the story, was the first time the security man admitted he had actually dropped my charger hard on the floor as he disconnected. The manager after resolving the case Infront of everyone including other library users, said sorry and asked me whether I was happy with everything which ofcourse at this point I wasn't.<br><br>Please note, there no one point where this security man apologised even after portraying me as a liar and proving he's the one that lied- which the manager witnessed.
21;under-used;Gareth, please spend more time getting some art in for people to look at than answering every single review with a lengthy "thank you blah blah". On Trip Advisor the owner is not supposed to be so involved.<br>More importantly, the musuem and the and special exhititions on the ground floor aren't a patch on what they were in the early 2000s. Almost no-one likes videos, almost everyone likes big installation art like the turbine hall at tate modern. you used to be brilliant at that. This would be expensiive I accept, but even getting some stuff out of the musuem store would cost nothing and be better than the empty spaces you give us today.
21;Return visit;We visited this gallery shortly after it opened in 1996 and thoroughly enjoyed that visit. Twenty five years later we made a long overdue return visit.<br><br>We also thoroughly enjoyed this visit as well. Some very intriguing displays and every floor had something to surprise us.<br><br>This is a great asset to Glasgow and a 'must see' to visitors to the city.<br><br>Free entry so a donation is a nice gesture <br><br>Recommended
21;Quick visit;Any time I’m in Glasgow city center I pop in here for a visit. With such a good location it’s easy to visit when you’re out for lunch or shopping. There’s a cafe and a nice shop too and it’s great that entry is free.  <br><br>This is a small gallery so you’ll be out in an hour. There’s always something interesting to see, even if it’s not your cup of tea. There are often new exhibits and displays so each time you’ll something new. The baking itself is great to walk round, I love the stained glass windows. <br><br>The only real negative is that it closes at 5 o’clock. It would be good if the gallery was open later.
21;Good art but mid-Covid restrictions reduce enjoyment;Interesting gallery organised over a number of levels. Features video and mixed media works as well as paintings. The gallery is clearly learning how to operate mid-Covid, with an overly zealously enforced one way system and a lack of seating throughout. This marred the visit for us to a certain extent - and we are by far not the least able of guests. The Covid risks of sharing seats needs to be weighed against the gains of being able to experience art in its fullest... And ensuring art is accessible to all.
21;Interesting - Some Good Pieces;Art is in the eye of the beholder and this maxim hold true for modern art. Located in central Glasgow this is an interesting gallery with a collection of good pieces and others that are less impressive. The building’s architecture is grand, and leads to spacious galleries and wide staircases. It is definitely worth a visit.
21;Interesting gallery with some great art pieces.;Really interesting gallery with some fantastic exhibitions. Free to enter with donations highly appreciated. There is lots to see on all the floors across the gallery, including sculptures and paintings/photography. Give yourself enough time to look around and take it all in.
21;Classical building;GOMA is in a repurposed classical building.     The interior is quite elegant,  with temporary exhibits and a small permanent collection on several floors.  <br>There is an interesting staircase, and the pediment,  as well as the entry foyer are lined with mosaics.    <br>There is a bookstore and small cafe in the basement.
21;Small but perfectly formed;Housed in a small building that looks a bit like a Roman temple or Victorian bank is the Gallery of Modern Art. It is small but IMHO perfectly formed both structurally inside and with what's being displayed. I was especially  impressed with Gallery 4 and Domestic Bliss.<br>There's a great little shop on the ground floor and the lift (elevator) was particularly impressive.<br>Definitely worth a visit !

22;Walk the Green - Chill Out;We enjoyed simply walking through Glasgow Green and admiring the scenery from public art, buildings, statues and the River Clyde. It is a beautiful part of the city and has a number of institutions close by. The paths are wide and it is easy to navigate.
22;Love this Heart of  the City;A one hour walk will let you see the many architectural  jewels Glasgow's oldest park has to offer. The old entrance arch on crown street leads you to a beautiful tree lined avenue winding toward Nelson's  Column. On the right lies the River Clyde with one of two magnificent suspension or Swinging bridges. On the left lies a  clutch of delights, the wonderful former Templeton  carpet factory aka Doge's Palace, the Peoples Palace and Victorian Tropical plant glasshouse and the Architectural  jewel of Victoria Fountain. There are many dear green open spaces and paths for pleasant walking. A place i have known since childhood that i hope to return to soon to play free concerts on good weather days.
22;Wide Open Space;The People's Green is a huge open space on the East side of the city centre. There are lots of well maintained paths to stroll down and open spaces.<br><br>It's a great area to come and relax after a busy day exploring.
22;Horrific;Would not recommend, biggest waste of money and time!! Full of underage children out their face and throwing drinks everywhere. DO NOT pay for VIP tickets, I promise you will be so disappointed and you will waste alot of money. Save the hassle and book a decent concert. Security are useless and just as bad as the kids who are out their face!
22;Excellent walk;I have walked thru Glasgow Green many times over the last 50 years. Yesterday I walked in at the High St entrance and followed the Riverwalk along the Clyde to Dalmarnock - it’s about 4 miles round trip. The walk takes you past several boathouses and bridges along well-kept and generally clean pathways in a very pleasant setting. It’s hard to believe that you are so close to the City Centre. You will also see the great greenhouses attached to The Peoples Palace. There are play areas for kids, a large football centre and a mixture of street parking (mostly metered but some free spaces). It’s an excellent walk.
22;Love it;This is one of my favourite places in Glasgow. If you want to go a run have a picnic or do some sightseeing this place is ideal. Home to the the world's tallest terracotta fountain and the first monument to Nelson after his famous Battle.
22;Beautiful green place .......;This Glasgow Green was actually not on our list of places to visit :-) We went here just for a free toilet stop. But we never regretted it to visit this green beautiful place. We spent almost one and half hour here to enjoy it and take some beautiful photo's .......
22;The Glasgow Show;I was at the Glasgow Show in Glasgow Green today it was awesome!!  The live bands were fab stars from the X-Factor and Britains got talent, Jedward, Jai McDowell etc<br>The stunt teams included fantastic motor bike stunts Bolddog Lings, parachute stunts and many more great entertainers. Thank you Glasgow great value for money!
22;A local gem;A beautiful park with so much history. <br>Loads of space to enjoy the sunshine on the grass and a lovely long loop which we do frequently.  Love it here.
22;Beautiful and serene place;Wish we had more time. This place is heaven if you love greenery. I especially loved the succelents portion
22;Lovely afternoon;Had a walk round Glasgow Green never been before. The weather was cold and sunny. A lovely green space in the heat of the city. I recommend the people's Palace it's free. It tells the story of Glasgow through recent history with the steamy, tenaments, a corner shop amongst the exhibits. Had a bowl of soup in the tea room there very tasty. Make sure to have a good look at the doulton fountain impressive. Also the old carpet factory over the road amazing architecture
22;Aye...;Glasgow green is alright but Glasgow blue is 10 times better.. Welcome to the party.. *****54 and counting

23;Off the Beaten Path House;From Central Station, took ScotRail train to Neilston (every 30 minutes, takes about 15 mins).  When I got off the train, there were no signs for Holmwood house or any hints. walked to the main street and asked a shop but they never heard of Holmwood house. Tried walking to the left, under the bridge and spotted a sign. It was an uphill walk through a residential area, which felt long was probably only 10 minutes.  Approaching the house, I was very surprised – it was so intriguing and modern looking although built in 1867. All visitors are required to book a tour slot to be escorted through and there were six other people at the 1130 slot. <br><br>What an interesting house and so unexpected! It turns out that the renovation was just completed and this is the first season that the house has been open with the new furnishings and wall frescoes etc. Extremely vibrant colors, very 1920s or 30s looking but this was done in 1867. The restoration team figured out what carpet designs would have been used at that time and designed new ones to replicate the old ones and boy, are they lush, thick, great colors and designs
23;Amazing restoration work;We first visited Holmwood about 20 years ago, we were impressed with the actual property, whilst recognising that there was still a huge amount to do to restore it, both outside and especially inside. Well, that has now been done, in spades. The interiors are a design and architechtural triumph of the restorer's art, and gives a glimpse of what this house must have been like when it was first built. The attention to detail of Thomson's design is staggering. Thoroughly recommended.<br>If you can get a guide to explain the background to the building and to the trickier parts of the restoration, so much the better. <br>There is also a lovely wee cafe, and a kitchen garden and more extensive grounds to wander around.
23;Beautiful house and brilliant staff;After traveling for five hours we decided to stop off at Holmwood yesterday. What an amazing place. Due to traffic we had missed our tour slot but when I apologised on arrival, the very kind and friendly admission staff said we could still have a tour round as space available. One staff member offered to walk the dog while we saw the house. The lovely tour guide was very kind and knowledgeable. The house is stunning. Beautiful Greek design decor and although quite small really magnificent. The kitchen garden is in full bloom and very relaxing. Great coffee shop. Our dog, Bernie had a lovely time too. All three staff were outstanding, friendly, kind and helpful. <br>If you are visiting Glasgow, a visit to Holmwood is a must. Its set in beautiful woodland, feels like the middle of the countryside not the centre of a bustling city. <br>Thank you NTS for a very memorable visit .
23;An architectural gem;Holmwood has extensive grounds which was great for letting our dog run off steam.  I'm not a great fan of guided tours as they're very much dependent on the quality of the guide, but I had a very knowledgeable and engaging guide.  She gave a fascinating insight into the work of Alexander "Greek" Thomson and the client who commissioned Holmwood.  Not the easiest of places to find so use a SatNav.
23;The best jewel in Glasgow's crown.;Holmwood is a real jewel in the crown of Scottish National Trust - and has a lot to teach the English National Trust.  We saw it years ago when they rescued it and it was near-derelict, and its regeneration to the highest possible standard is a wonder.  Its redecoration is so amazing that you would love to live there ! It also has very friendly and informed staff who bring the property and the story of its transformation to life if you didn't know it when you arrive. Definitely not to be missed when you visit Glasgow, and well worth visiting Glasgow just to see Holmwood !
23;Memorable house by a very interesting architect.;Holmwood House has been carefully restored by the National Trust for Scotland, to a very high standard.  There is a lot of good explanatory information about Alexander "Greek" Thomson and his work.  It's definitely worth a visit.  The staff were really helpful and welcoming.  I have only one criticism - the cafe didn't serve anything for lunch, only tea, coffee and cakes.
23;Great guide   great house;The retired  gentlemen who was our guide was superb unfortunately  we didn't catch his name.  He was so knowledgeable  and made our visit enjoyable and educational.<br>Thanks for a great visit we would strongly advise a visit to this nts property.
23;Amazing Venue and Staff.;Upfront this is a review from having a Civil Partnership in this house inI January 2018, I should have written a review before now. I could only mentally now.<br><br>Firstly on the building. It's a stunner and not always on people's first thought of when going to Glasgow but everyone go this is a stuning buiding that is not as well known as it should be. A beautiful home by the Mr Greek Thomson, one of my favourite architects...So please go and help with it's restoration.<br><br>So on the staff there. All I can say they are amazing both employed and volunteers. Back story I was meant to have my civil partnership for my 10 year anniversary. Ill health took my partner and I had to bring this forward to 5 days days. The staff were amazing and made it work for us and bent over backwards to make it so and I thank you very much. If it weren't for the staff my husband wouldn't have got his dying wish. So many thanks from myself and everyone who attended.<br><br>Mr Jago
23;A Greek Thomson Classic;A beautiful Greek Thomson villa on Glasgow’s Southside. The rooms have been gorgeously restored to their previous glory. We enjoyed our tour with Robert who was very enthusiastic and knowledgeable and looked after us perfectly. <br>We had coffee in the gardens after our tour.<br>A lovely property.
23;A Sleeping Beauty of a House;I visited Holmwood over thirty years ago when it was still part of a school. We were on an evening class architectural visit and I loved the Alexander "Greek" Thomson details of the house. My recent visit was a bit of a disappointment. If it hadn't been for the detailed directions from the lady in the Greenbank Gardens tearoom, I should never have found the house. Signposting is almost non-existent. If you have any problems with mobility, use the disabled parking spaces behind the house and the nearby disabled access. You have to ring and wait - in the rain, if the weather is bad. I foolishly walked all round the house to the front entrance and had to walk up a flight of steps with no handrail or banister. The staff inside the house are superb - warm and welcoming and very well-informed. What is slightly shocking is how shabby and run-down the walls, floors and ceilings look. Decoration is supposed to be ongoing - but at a glacial pace. The furnishings are terrific but not original. There is a lift tucked away to take you to the upper level where the upstairs sitting room and bedrooms are really worth seeing. If you are seven or under you can ride the rocking horse in one of the bedrooms. Back downstairs, in the former staff quarters, is a little tearoom with very few choices. However, my pot of tea was freshly made - with a smile. I feel that the National Trust for Scotland should allocate more money for the refurbishment of Holmwood. It is a neglected gem - compared to properties nearer Edinburgh.
23;Poor;I visited Holmwood House for the first and last time today.<br><br>On arriving the door was chained shut. I rang the bell to be greeted by a very ignorant woman. I told her I wanted to view the property, that is supposed to open at 12 noon. She proceeded to inform me that it wasn't time yet, but by my watch and GMT it was 12.10 pm. On letting us in she quickly passed us off to another member of staff. <br><br>The house itself is just okay. I don't think it warranted a fee of £6.50 a head. Some of the rooms were barely furnished and the ones that were, were decorated to what the trust presumed they should look like, no to exactly the way they should be. The plus side is the grounds are nice, but you could visit them without having to deal with rude staff or being ripped off on entry price.<br><br>Poor customer service, rude staff, not worth the visit unless you have a free entry pass.
23;Alexander "Greek" Thomson;This is the last remaining Villa designed by Thomson. And is really beautiful. Conservators' have removed wall coverings and paint in parts of every area of the house so that the original décor may be imagined. Originally the decoration was stencilled directly on to the plaster. My Partner and I volunteer as guides in the house when it is open from April to October. Three principal events are run in the house these being Christmas, Easter and the best Halloween in Glasgow. I could go on for pages but suggest that you go to the trouble of finding it on the National Trust for Scotland website and pay it a visit. You will be intrigued.

24;Fantastic tour - definitely recommended;Had a great tour - lasted about 90 minutes and our guide was absolutely brilliant and made it so engaging and informative. Tour took in all the main historic areas of the Bill Struth main stand including the main stairwell, managers room, press room, blue room, trophy room, directors box, home and away dressing room, the tunnel and the dug out. Fantastic experience with lots of photo opportunities. Highly recommend for any rangers fan or football fan or simply anyone just interested in the history of the club and building.
24;A tour not to be missed;Favourite part was sitting in the dug out looking over the magnificent pitch. The trophy room was brilliant amazing to see all the achievements and also the tour guide was fantastic Lawrence knew everything there is to know and made us all feel very much a part of the club. I would recommend this tour to anyone wishing to see an iconic building built with marble and the best wooden panelling. Walking in the main doors of Ibrox was amazing a place steeped in history.
24;Simply the best;From start to finish the tour was brilliant, made extra soecial by our tour guide lawrence. He spent time explaining the history of the club as well as having a sense if humour. It was my sons birthday and made the experience a perfect  treat.going diwn the dugout onto the park with “ simply the best” playing was something we wont forget.
24;The Famous Ibrox Tour;The Ibrox tour from start to finish was an amazing day. it was hosted by John, who is an excellent ambassador for the club with his amazing knowledge of the clubs history, his family had work at the club from the legendary Bill Stuth era to the present manager. he laid the foundations from the legendary stories to the funny stories, It is a tour that every Rangers fan should take. We thank you Rangers FC for an amazing Day 👏 💙
24;Incredible.;Incredible tour. John kept it light hearted and interesting throughout. An absolute must for any Rangers fan or football fan in general. Made me proud to be a Ranger listening to the stories. John’s personal stories about his family who have worked at Ibrox in the past is a brilliant touch.
24;Would revisit in a heartbeat;Wow what can I say the best tour I have ever been on, John was the most amazing tour guide! He had family history towards Ibrox and that gave a little extra to the tour as he could speak from a personal background! Would highly recommend taking a visit, amazing club, fantastic tour guides, very well dressed and could see John took pride in that, fantastic knowledge and stories overall it was the best experience ever! The clubs history is something else! Well done to everyone that is associated with Ibrox you do a brilliant job!
24;Breathtaking;There are no words to properly describe the feeling of walking in through the front door at Ibrox and up the Marble staircase past the hall of fame, but if I could pick one it would be remarkable. The entire tour from start to finish was outstanding and befitting a club with such high standards. A special mention to Mr Gallacher our tour guide, his family history and story's really helped to personalise the tour and illustrated the family club that Rangers are.<br>I would highly recommend this tour for any sports fan or a fan of history. You cannot fail to be impressed with such an amazing place.<br><br>*Side note* The Negative/Terrible comments found on these reviews predominantly come from weird folk that support another team in Glasgow. Please disregard them as it doesn't bare true resemblance to the actual tour.
24;Simply the best…;I went here with my family for my uncles birthday and it was an amazing experience! The building (main stand) is beautiful inside and out, the history of the club is incredible. The tour guide was amazing, you could tell he really loved the club, but he was also really friendly and just very easy-going. Even if you’re not a Rangers fan, I think any football fan could appreciate how impressive the stadium is.
24;Ipox;Attending in the away end. Insufficient turnstiles led to many fans missing kick off. Emailed rangers to enquire and was very rudely fobbed off. You'd think I was asking for a tax payment. Overpriced cardboard "pie" and disgusting unsanitary toilets. Simply the best??
24;Hospitality in Club Europe;Travelled up especially to do this and was well worth it. If you haven't done hospitality before then try it out as an experience! Arrived at 6 and went to the Club Europe suite where you can help yourself to tapas and various foods from a buffet. They also had a range of lovely desserts to choose from after that. You can head to the bar and have whatever you fancy until 15 mins before kick off. The staff were brilliant. A much more relaxed style of hospitality, which I prefer to the formal sit down meal set up. Match programmes and team sheets are delivered on arrival and a club legend or 2 will pop in to say hello to everyone. Comfy leather seats for the match were right at the front of the Club Deck tier. Bonus of post match drinks for an hour too to get your money's worth. Brilliant day out.
24;Stadium Tour;Went for a tour with my son (age11) -.had a great day. Both season ticket holders so regular visitors, but a fantastic experience to enjoy the phenomenal history the club is immersed in.<br>Tour guide (John) was great, and invited someone's child up to help translate - which was absoloutly fantastic. I felt that this helped make the experience far more personalised and accessible for this family, which is a huge thing is today's society.<br><br>Full access to the stadium, different rooms, changing rooms, directors box etc, and fantastic photo opportunities throughout. <br><br>A great day out, and really props and shout out to the Tour guide we had (John), like mentioned above, he delivered the Tour in such a personalised way.
24;Absolutely Brilliant!;As a family of 5, we all loved this tour. The tour guide, John, had a genuine enthusiasm, passion and knowledge for the club which was passed on to everyone in the group.This was great value for money and would highly recommend. Great day👍👍

25;Wonderful day out;What an interesting museum to visit, with all forms of transport to look at, from Cars, trains, trams, bicycles, skateboards etc. A street with old shops the interiors actually transported to the museum to show how it was originally. It has a restaurant on the ground floor (which we didn't go In) and a little Cafe on the 1st floor, which apparently makes the best coffee, I had a green tea and a lovely biscuit, made fresh with raspberry and lemon mmm. The best bit for me was the free tour and out Guide Jean was amazing, born and bred in Glasgow, she was full of stories and Information, and made it really enjoyable. We were lucky enough to be the only ones who took up the offer with this tour slot, so we had her to ourselves. We were like old friends and was sad to see her go after spending time chatting. I would recommend this museum for all the family, and there were quite a lot of toddlers there today, which was nice to see. The museum itself is free entry and there is a ship outside you can go onto that is also free but the weather was awful today so we decided not to go onboard. Definitely ask for Jean to be your guide and you won't be disappointed. Thank you Jean you made our day. We'd 2nd November 22
25;Back in time;We were staying nearby and enjoyed the walk along the Clyde to this museum, however there is a large payable car park area if you are driving.<br>Entrance is free but you can make a donation either on entry or at one of the collection points around the museum.<br>The whole place including toilets and restaurant was very clean.<br>There is a good collection of cars, bikes, fire engines, trams etc and the mock up cobbled streets with shops is excellent. <br>Some of the exhibits need a little more investigation into their use as some of the placards were slightly misleading.<br>The cars on the wall were interesting but some of them are just too high up to view. <br>The tall ship docked at the rear looks good, but we didn't get on here as it is closed Mondays and Tuesdays. <br>It's a good place to visit for a morning or an afternoon and I would recommend visiting here for great nostalgia for older people and to let younger people see how transport and daily life has evolved over time.
25;Ghostbusters and Halloween theme;I visited the museum and Tall Ship with my 7.5 year old and 5 year old during the October school holidays.<br><br>Having been here before, it's a great place for all ages. There's a mix of historical information about the exhibits, interactive displays and opportunities for children to engage. It's a wonderful example of how museums can cater to all ages.<br><br>On this visit, I was excited to see the Ghostbusters vehicle and an added bonus was to meet the Ghostbusters of Glasgow who took photos with visitors - brilliant!<br><br>The Halloween theme was fun and actives included a ghost trail and making ghost crafts on the Tall Ship.<br><br>The Tall Ship Glenlee is superb and wonderful to explore above and below deck. Great views of the Clyde too. Well done to the staff who helped kids with their Halloween crafts!<br><br>We arrived for noon and got parked no problem. The car parking charges are pretty steep (£5.20 for 3 hours for me today!) so make sure you download the RingGo app beforehand as I certainly didn't have £5 worth of pound coins on me! <br><br>3 hours allowed us to take our time to see everything as well as eat our packed lunch. There are tables dotted about the museum or picnic tables outside. Look out for the upstairs mini cafe which is a nice place to eat. The main cafe/restaurant was busy so didn't get to try it as the queue was long. <br><br>Great facilities - toilets catered for little ones. Water fountains, baby change, lifts, high chairs etc. which is what you'd expect from a modern building. Staff welcoming and friendly. Cleaners going round all afternoon. Smashing for somewhere that is free to enter. Gift shop had a keenly priced mixture of tat and souvenirs. <br><br>Outside there was a mini carnival which added to the school holidays and Halloween vibes. <br><br>Overall, a great afternoon visit and the museum continues to impress and maintain high standards as a must-see attraction. Enjoy!
25;Ok but staff need training on disability;The museum is free to visit but again no direct public transport acess unless you are on the city sightseeing tour buses. You have to get the subway or train to partick and a long walk along a busy road <br><br>There is plenty to see but the main hall seems to be very cramed in<br><br>I have a "Hidden disability" that means I struggle to use a masks. I had my lanyard on show but as soon as I walked in I had a member of staff shouting at me to put a mask on  I felt that was quite unprofessional  considering its a tourist attraction if it was paid admission I would have got the manager and asked for a refund.i found this experience quite distressing
25;Another good visit;We visited (my oldest grandson who is 6 and myself) on a Saturday. The museum is fairly well sign-posted and there is plenty of on-site parking. The car park was about half full so the museum was busy. Parking is £1.60 per hour but entry to the museum (and the adjacent Tall Ship) is free. <br><br>Mask- wearing is compulsory though compliance was patchy. About 20% didn’t bother at all which is poor is an indoor environment with lots of kids. <br><br>The exhibits were as good as we remembered. As well as car, buses, trams, trains and ships, there is an old Glasgow street with a subway station and shops including a pub. A real taste of Old Glasgow. <br><br>The first floor coffee shop was closed but the main restaurant was open (but very busy so we didn’t bother). <br><br>It’s an enjoyable visit which you do at your own pace. We spent about an hour there. But you could easily spend a few hours looking at all the exhibits. <br><br>A good place to go.
25;Well worth a visit so much to see;This is a free museum but you can provide donations on entry. There is so much to see you could spend the whole day here. There is a coffee shop on site which was quite expensive but you can take your own food and drink in with you. There is also a tall ship outside of the museum which you can visit which takes an hour to go round the ship. There is also a cafe on the ship providing food and drink. Would highly recommend this museum
25;Always good;Been here a handful of times with my partner and our 3 year old and it’s always a good experience. <br><br>As my son gets older he enjoys it<br>more and more (so much so there was a slight tantrum when it was time to leave today!). He particularly enjoyed the little fire engine and putting out the ‘fires’ in the buildings with the hose. <br><br>We only discovered the cafe for the first time today which was busy but food was pleasant and arrived fairly quickly despite the number of people.<br><br>A great way to spend a rainy afternoon for all ages.
25;Well worth a visit;Stopped off at the museum whilst on the bus tour. Spent a very couple of hours enjoying the wide range of exhibits. The museum is very clean and well laid out. There is something for all ages. Entrance is free with a suggested small donation.
25;Good visit cut spoiled;I know everyone is trying their best in covid times but the rapid museum emptying times at the day's end is causing me to leave what would normally be a 5 circle review attraction only 3 circles.<br><br>We had booked online in advance (which you have to do at the moment) but could only get the 4pm slot. We knew the place closed at 5 and just had an hour.<br><br>That was all understood and fine.  What we didnt expect was to be evicted from the museum prior to 5.<br><br>At 4.45, a tannoy announces museum closing in 15 mins.<br><br>At 4.50, another tannoy announcement. Closing 10 mins<br><br>At 4.55, staff approach and tell you to leave.<br><br>Was most annoying as we were just finishing off the AV presentation about the Raleigh Chopper bikes which is very close to the exit door. Literally it would have taken all of 10 seconds to get from there and off the premises.<br><br>A man approached at 4.55 and told us to make our way to the exit. We hovered a few seconds more, then a lady told us to leave. Then the first man said we had to leave right away.<br><br>We were outside the building by 4.57.  <br><br>I really think, with these booking times, a less rigid approach would be welcomed. The museum was quiet. We would have all been out of there by 5 of our own volition. <br><br>I would not advise taking the 4pm slot for this reason. 60 mins is enough time for a quick over view of everything but, really it is 55 mins tops you get and you cant really relax after 45 mins due to tannoy reminders.
25;Sir Clive Sinclair destroyed;Had a visit to the Riverside Museum and was enjoying it until I had a walk upstairs and came across the section on Sir Clive Sinclair. Wow, they really put the boot in to the guy!<br>I was shocked by the content and subsequent negative subliminal output from that particular display. How can they be allowed to destroy such an amazing entrepreneur? Who signed off on this? They bash his watch, calculator, spectrum computer, battery application for cycles, the bicycle he designed and then absolutely annihilate the C5. <br>Children are both stimulated and destroyed by words and images. How can a child look at that display and then want to be an entrepreneur or a designer?<br>If the content creators knew anything about business or life they would recognize that failure is part of the process of growth and success.<br>Maybe an idea for the team at the museum to think twice about content and take time to stand back and look again at what has been created around a man who opened up the world of computing for millions of people throughout the world.<br>In regards to the museum as a whole some exhibits were superb - world class actually - whilst a few were bordering on laughable. The wall of cars is beyond my comprehension. I had a sore neck trying to view cars displayed many metres above my head. Having visited the premiership class of the Petersen Museum in LA and the Louwman Collection in The Netherlands this museums car displays were simply non league. The Arnold Clark Group is also allowed way too much advertising whilst the bicycle exhibit was impossible to view.<br>Staff were courteous and very friendly.  As a complete review 5/10 for the museum. Could do better. Not thought out well. Some amazing exhibits, but badly laid out and poorly executed in some areas.
25;Good day out;Had a week off from work so had a staycation. We rucked up to the museum only to be disappointed to find out you need to book 24 hours in advance. We knew it was free entry so didn’t think about booking….DOH! Thankfully there were places the next day so we booked and returned the next day.<br><br>We had been at the old Transport Museum and remember some negative reviews when this one opened up. I don’t know why it got negative reviews in the past as we both thought it was fantastic (and we both loved the old museum too). The setting on the Clyde is fantastic. Our favourite part is still the old Glasgow street. Because of COVID you couldn’t get inside the old trolleys but it was still good to just get up and wee them all. We went to the Tall Ship afterwards and enjoyed that as well. <br><br>There are two food stalls in front of the museum and we had lunch there afterwards. Loving setting. <br>If you have an electric car there are several charge points in the car park - including 2 rapid chargers. They appear to be heavily used, but people charge and go so it was easy to get charged up.
25;Worth a visit;Well worth s visit especially if you are on the sight seeing bus from the city centre, it’s free as well so great in the current cost crisis.<br><br>Well laid out, great range of exhibits. Shop ok if tad expensive, but worth a hour or so
26;Excellent and interesting exhibits;We arrived just after 4 pm today, after some time lost looking for a nearby parking lot. The museum building’s  architecture was big and impressive . Exhibits were wide and varied, ranging from art works, Egyptian history, wild animals, rain forests, war etc. As the museum closes at 5 pm, we could only manage a quick tour of the 2 floors of exhibits. The museum does not levy an entrance fee but visitors were encouraged to drop a 5 pounds donation in boxes which is very reasonable.
26;Kelvingrove Museum and Gallery;I just love this iconic building . There's so much you can see and do in the art gallery/museum .  Don't miss the daily organ recital at 1PM  . <br><br>For the general museum and art gallery the entrance is free, ....there is a charge for any  special exhibitions. .......   but any donations are greatly appreciated . <br><br>There's a coffee shop serving drinks /light snacks/cakes and pastries throughout the day and a gift shop with a wide variety of merchandise .<br><br>An ideal way to spend a rainy day in Glasgow ....or any other dat as well .
26;Excellent four hour visit,;The moment  I entered the museum I was meat by a gentleman who explained all about the museum, it’s facilities and information on the lay out and exhibits. I headed for the downstairs cafe and had a Sterling sausage roll and coffee for breakfast. They have a varied menu so plenty to choose from. All the staff I spoke to during my four hour visit were really really friendly and so very helpful. There was lots to see, and learn about. Take a look at the website for more info.Entry to the museum is free, but if you are able to leave a donation it is gratefully received. There is a regular bus service from Argyle street, which is the road just in front of the museum. The no 77 bus will take you into the city centre. The bus drivers are really friendly and helpful too. Just remember to tap on your credit or debit card when you get on the bus, and don’t forget to tap it again before you get off. I would definitely recommend a visit to this venue.
26;Great place ruined by poor parking provision;The museum and gallery itself is well worth a visit, however the parking is an issue.<br>Firstly the machines don't give change, and the parking charge is 1.20 an hour, so you are guaranteed to need small change to pay. However, the catch is the machines don't give change and don't prorata your stay, so if you pay 2 pounds you only get one hour, and no change!<br>Add in the fact that the council have, in their infinite wisdom, closed of the bottom end of Kelvin Way (in some sort of misguided pro-cycling initiative) which means if you come along Argyle St and turn up Kelvin Way the only place you can go is the car park for the museum (which isn't very big) - you aren't able to drive up and park on Kelvin Way itself. If you want to park on Kelvin Way you need to enter from the University end. So if the car park is full you've got to drive miles (no left turn out of the museum to find alternative parking).
26;Magical;There is something a bit magical about both the building itself and the exhibits inside. You could literally lose yourself for hours in the plethora of art, culture and exhibitions. There is such a wide variety of things to see that there really is something for everyone. My daughter and I spent a very happy few hours in here and there’s no way we came close to seeing it all.<br>Parking is plentiful and easy (pay and display)<br>The cafe serves really decent food and is reasonably priced. It’s staffed by an efficient and friendly team.<br>If you only visit one place on a visit to Glasgow then this really should be it!!
26;Interesting Museum;It was a good museum with interesting artefacts and exhibits. The adults and the kids learnt a lot! The food was slightly on the pricey side ( understandably given that the museum doesnt charge an entrance fee) but they had picnic areas for you to bring your own food. So cost conscious families might want to consider that.
26;Free admission to fantastic art gallery and museum;There is something for everyone at this fantastic gallery/museum. I love the great halls where you will find eclectic displays of an old airplane suspended overhead of some large mammals like elephants and a giraffe as well as a stuffed ostrich. Another hall will have a suspension of expressive white heads overhanging a lovely split staircase, while in another hall you will hear the great vibrations of a pipe organ blasting through the room with an attentive audience looking up in awe. It's free admission and well worth the visit, with a restaurant on site, 3 shops and a coffee kiosk.
26;Magnificent inside and out.  Something for all ages and everyone's taste.;Before you even enter this imposing building, you will marvel at its location within Kelvingrove Park, adjacent to the University of Glasgow and opposite the Kelvin Hall, the site of G.B. Davis Cup glory. Just over 10 mins from the city centre, this masterpiece of architecture is definitely worth a visit.  Its chandelier-decked entrance hall housing a beautiful organ is worth the entrance fee alone which with astonishment is FREE.<br>As for the exhibits, they range from world -renown artists like Dali, the Dutch, Italian and French masters, Lowry and the Impressionists to Ancient Egyptian artefacts to furniture through the Ages, stuffed animals ( Roger the Elephant is magnificent) and even a Spitfire !!!!   Look out for Elvis as he is the building as well !!! An excellent place to visit for quick looksee or a day's in depth culture.  In Covid times, pre booking is essential. Thoroughly recommended. Enjoy.
26;Excellent for a free attraction;Walked here from the city centre (about 30 minutes walk from St Enoch Centre) to check out the museum.<br><br>Glad we did, for free entry it was definitely worth it. Beautiful building, lots of beautiful art to look at and also a variety of sections including wildlife, ancient Egypt, Charles Rennie Macintosh and more.  We especially enjoyed the ancient Egypt section as a couple of the narratives on the exhibits gave us a giggle. Thank you to whoever wrote them! <br><br>Something for everyone, there was a mix of ages there when we visited from school children to adults.  There was an organ recital at 1pm if you like that sort of thing too.
26;A must see!;It's free and amazing!  The building is stunning an the exhibits are so unique that it keeps you interested a long time.  And they do a lot to make sure the kids are interested as well.  For example, along side the medieval amour are animal skulls with an explanation of how they both protect us.  So unexpected and probably my favorite museum now.
26;A must visit if your in Glasgow;This is a great day out for all the family, with many varied exhibitions. It is a uniquely Victorian era building with a giant entrance hall that has daily organ music recitals. The museum has a small cafe that is very cheap and a great place to grab a coke and a sandwich if your wanting something quick and easy with small children. Alternatively there's a bright large basement restaurant that has a quieter atmosphere, the food they serve up is very good quality and well priced. The museum additionally has regular exhibitions in another basement area that charge a small fee for entry but the displays here are well worth the money. Entry to the normal museum is free.
26;First class museum and gallery;The Kelvingrove is an exceptional gallery. First of all the building itself is worth a visit as it is quite magnificent and there is some interesting information about its history dotted around.<br><br>A very helpful member of staff explained that broadly one side of the collection is focused on art where the other is more of a museum and is particula

27;Pleasant morning exploring a beautiful house;Spent a lovely day on the Pollok Country Estate.  Started with a walk around the grounds, which are stunning with lots of squirrels and highland cattle to admire.  Then popped into the House.  The reviews here are quite mixed and I assume reflect the experience in relation to other Houses in the area.<br><br>I personally quite enjoyed my time there.  I'm someone that appreciates history and can happily spend an hour wandering around a house, admiring paintings and old furniture.  The guide, Jill was also very friendly and knowledgeable.  You could really tell she loves her job and takes an interest in the house.  To be fair, there were guides scattered throughout the building and all of them seemed cheery and happy to be there, which is not always the case in this industry.<br><br>I do think, however, that it would be nice if the visit was conducted as a full guided tour instead of just the first couple of rooms before you're left to wander off by yourself.  I found it a bit strange that it wasn't done that way.  Alternatively, perhaps an audio guide could be introduced to enhance the experience?<br><br>I didn't have anything in the café so I can't comment on that.  I walked through it.  It looked ok but nothing overly enticing.<br><br>There was also an interesting exhibition on the top floor worth exploring.
27;Good to visit;We visited in May 2022.  The house is easy to get to from Glasgow's Central Station to Pollokshaws West station and is much further up the same estate road as the Burrell Collection.  There is signage to the house but we missed it.   One has to head for the Highland cattle and then keep going.  The house is interesting and worth visiting but the cafe has limited seating and the outside space can only be used on a dry day.
27;Knowledgeable Staff;Lots of staff and volunteers to answer your questions about the House and Estate. The downstairs with its domestic staff areas is especially interesting… the cafe is located in the former kitchen which has much authentic detail. At the time of our visit the top floor had an exhibition of Japanese inspired paintings by Hornel (one of the Glasgow Boys) … and origami folding for the young and young at heart.
27;(Cafe review only) Shadow of its former self;Until recently the Edwardian cafe, which you can access without paying the house entrance fee, used to be a destination venue with a varied lunch menu where you could take visitors. It was was always packed. <br><br>It's now a snack bar with only hot drinks and overpriced pre-packaged muffins in cellophane on offer (plus at lunchtime, some soup). <br><br>It's very disappointing given the marvellous garden setting and architecture - I don't know what NTS are thinking. The nearby Burrell cafe might be fancy but it's very big and noisy like a swimming pool, so Pollok was always my preference but no more.
27;Very poor;This was very disappointing.  One nice young woman at the entrance and 2 guys. None of whom seemed to have much awareness of the collection.<br>This is sold on the basis of the collection of Spanish art. But there is no explanation of its importance when you're there. Some are hung high up so you can't read the labels. Plus the 1st floor was closed so we missed some.<br>Very poor, NTS should be ashamed.
27;Abysmal Management and Customer Communication.;Utterly exasperated trying to gain access to the house and paintings. Even their website provides no clue as to whether they’re open or shut. (They’re usually shut)<br><br>The staff at the house are great but the management and organisation of the attraction by the National Trust For Scotland is woeful. The running of the facility  should be handed over to the Burrell Collection who seem to have no difficulty staying open and communicating with customers.
27;Enlightening and enjoyable guided visit.;Having visited a few times previously (the house and gardens are lovely to wander round) we managed today to have a tour led by Gill. She was incredibly knowledgable about the house and it’s former residents. Understanding a bit more of the history of the place made us notice many aspects, artefacts, and interesting paintings in the house. A fabulous afternoon. <br>Would previously have recommended a visit but if you can arrange a tour too I am sure you want be disappointed.
27;Thrown out for a Wedding booking.;Its a fine National Trust of Scotland manged House and park. However it closes often for Weddings or other money making events and members and the public are made very unwelcome on those occasions.<br>The cafe in the original Staff basement is fun rather than great, and now has inside and outside seating.
27;Frustrating;Went to see the Maud Sutler exhibtion.<br>Place was closed, no mention on websites , or notices outside. Signs were up pointing to a way in, which was locked. Walked around, everything including cafe shut. Noticed lights on so had a looked, some poeple inside who ignored me.
27;Arrive early or you won’t get in!!;Went around four o clock (an hour ahead of the advertising closing time) only to find that they were closed, totally ridiculous especially after travelling so far to visit! A young man told us that the gardens were open which we did enjoy (hence the second star that we wouldn’t be putting otherwise!).
27;Lovely walks around the grounds;Worth a visit in the house itself lots to see. You will probably spend around 2 hours in the house and there are staff around to give you some background on the house as well. There is a coffee shop on site also with inside and outside seating areas. There are lots of walks to do around the grounds of the house with some beautiful views
27;Wonderful Experience;What a wonderful place! I would highly recommend this hidden gem (even more if you are an Outlander fan!). A great tour. Beautiful grounds. We took the Scot Rail to get here and walked. The walk was gorgeous and very flat and took about 20 minutes to get to the front gates. On the way you can see the Scotland cows, flowers, trees, plants and birds. A calming atmosphere with a lot of locals walking their dogs. The staff were very kind and answered all of our questions. We had Jill in the library who was very excited and knowledgeable about the house and even gave us an added bonus of speaking about some historical witch history in the area.  The cafe also has great snacks and delicious tea. We would recommend sitting outside if possible.
28;Disappointed;Very disappointed with the whole experience. Was asked if there were any allergies told them strawberries. They gave me strawberry jam with scones. Asked for sandwiches to be on brown bread, they came in all white bread. Ham had mustard on them, i don't like mustard but was not told it would be on ham. Service was poor, no one came asked if everything was ok or to see if we needed anything else. Heard so many nice things about willows couldn't wait to go.Wont be back.
28;A hidden gem !;Called in here for what was initially just a drink and maybe a light snack but ended up having much more due to the quality of the food. Fairly good choice on offer and it was fairly busy but we were made welcome from the start and seated within 5-10 mins. We both had cold drinks with sandwiches which were fresh and excellent in terms of quality and presentation. Enjoyed it so much (And the fact we were sat next to the dessert counter) we both ended up having a dessert which again was first class in terms of taste and quality. A little bit of a hidden gem given it is upstairs between a couple of shops but it is easy enough to find and certainly worth looking up if you are in the city centre. We would certainly recommend it !
28;Birthday Gift;Just had a great afternoon at the Willow Tearooms in Sauchiehall St. We took in the interactive exhibition first, a great history lesson about the 2nd city of the Empire and the people who were inspirational in it's growth. We then had a glorious afternoon tea with some fine savouries, delicious sandwiches and decadent scones and cakes, all served with our choice of teas from the menu. The staff left us feeling pampered with their attention, without being intrusive. Thanks all for a brilliant time.
28;Lovely afternoon tea in centre of Glasgow;Beautiful decor and very central. The food was fresh and tasty. Staff were professional, friendly and very attentive. We had a lovely afternoon tea with a nice bottle of Prosecco. Highly recommend.
28;Amazing!;My husband had booked us for an afternoon tea here while we were in Glasgow. Unfortunately when we arrived there was no electricity (whole block had none) we said we didn’t mind still having it without a hot drink. The manager was very kind and the staff were great. The sandwich’s were nice and soft and the scones had plenty of jam and cream and we got asked if we wanted any more jam or cream. The cakes were tasty too. The place was cold but that wasn’t the staffs fault. The electricity did come back on just as we finished so we got a cup of tea. Just also to say the manager did send us to another place for afternoon tea but the member of staff who spoke to us there was very rude and also said there was no room and so we went back to the willow tea room. As most people didn’t stay at the tea room and we went to the other place we got our afternoon tea for free. So super customer service and we will definitely return to pay for afternoon teas!
28;Enjoyed afternoon tea;A lovely welcome greeted us. We were shown to our table and given time to settle,then a young man explained the menu .The sandwiches and cakes were suburb. We asked to change some items and they were glad to do so .We also were allowed to take photos after asking.Altogether a wonderful experience.
28;Fun and High Quality;Super place for light lunch or high tea - in fact, very high tea as there are rather a lot of stairs to climb, so maybe not suitable for anyone with mobility issues. Food was excellent whilst the speed and movement of the waitresses looked like a choreographed performance!
28;2 different Willow Tea Rooms ?;Fulfilled a life long ambition to visit Rennie Mackintosh's tea room today.  Booked online but didn't realise there were two tea rooms. A bit confusing. Was disappointed not to have realised this and eat at the non original one. The food and service were excellent and partly made up for my disappointment. Staff were obviously stretched but the lovely young Manager was working very hard to keep everything running smoothly. Thank you all for a lovely afternoon.
28;Fantastic Service;My sister-in-law and l booked in advance for high tea. It was wonderful. Plenty of gluten free options for me. Our server was Leanne. Very attentive but not hovering over us. We absolutely loved our high tea and will certainly be back. Leanne is an absolute credit the Willow's, shes bright and cheery and certainly knows the menu. Thank you Leanne for making our visit so special.x
28;Worth a visit;Located on a main thoroughfare, this was a welcome refuge at a time when the skies really opened up. It is unfortunately accessed via stairs (that prevent wheelchair users visiting this location) that take you to reception area which has a variety of souvenirs on sale. Despite the inclement weather, the staff were welcoming and kept us informed as to the availability of a table. The premises were very clean and the staff extremely efficient in clearing the tables and ensuring the incoming diners had somewhere suitable to sit. The sausages with onion gravy, cheese and tomato tart followed by cheese scone and butter and an individual Victoria sponge accompanied by a breakfast tea and delicious Victorian lemonade were superb.
29;This is a review of restaurant and room;Restaurant was very good. Room very comfortable. Food was very good and staff very pleasant. The only thing I wished they had was gift shop. I was surprised also they don’t provide wash clothes too. Overall nice hotel and clean
29;Lovely stay at a busy hotel;We visited Glasgow as a family. Two adults, two teenagers. The hotel was really busy, though the service was excellent and the breakfasts fab. My son is coeliac and this is the best place he's ever stayed for gluten free breakfast. We chose the hotel due to having a car park, gym and pool. My son said the gym was very small - bit of a shame the leisure club is on the ground floor and you have to walk slightly through reception. It was a bit odd, that there wasn't any soap at all in the bathrooms - we had two rooms. When I asked at reception, they gave us body wash. I think it was a covid issue, but we've stayed elsewhere and had soap. As we arrived late one night, we had limited early breakfast option the following day, despite being Honours member. It would be great if you could book your breakfast slot online beforehand, like you can your rooms. We booked later for the following days though. The bar was lovely and the prices weren't that expensive either, which surprised me.
29;Larger hotel;Arrived around 1900 in the evening - my taxi from airport dropped just outside Hotel is one of the larger premises in Glasgow This will be the second time of staying Booked and exec room located on 8th floor with views of the inner city Room extremely large with sofa area , desk and super king Facilities on site are superb with swim and spa available with large on site restaurant Breakfast was superb , continental could be taken in exec lounge or hot offering in main dining room This hotel has got conference facilities on site so dependent on what’s in it could be busier than normal Good strong contender for stays in Glasgow with city around 2/3 min walk
29;Not as good as it used to be;Convenient hotel for city centre but not value for money. No info in the bedrooms such as rstaurant menu, room service menu. Terrible self service coffee at breakfast. Pancake machine not working which I had to point out to staff.
29;Highly recommend;Beautiful hotel. Very central. Food Lovely. Room was really spacious and comfortable. Staff could not be more helpful .especially reception staff. Even though hotel full and events on never heard any noise what so ever I my room
29;Afternoon Tea;Booked Afternoon tea as a late birthday treat for my sister and it didn’t disappoint, we were looked after by a lovely waiter Micheal , we were asked if we had any food allergies at start , chef made beautiful sandwiches all freshly made , the cakes were lovely but the scones were amazing we thoroughly enjoyed our afternoon
29;EUROPEAN DOUBLETREE IS FAR, FAR SUPERIOR TO DOUBLETREE USA...!!!;Diamond status goes a long way here, as evidenced by the wonderful care provided us by Cluster Groups Manager Euan and GM Andrew. We were fortunate enough to have a 6th-floor King 1-Bedroom Suite that is reportedly 881’ but felt like twice that, with its massive bedroom, a wall of windows that open, separate and equally as huge living room with not one but two couches, two easy chairs, a desk, even a four-bar-stool dining counter. The kitchen has a two-burner stove, microwave, very large refrigerator and enough counter space to whip up a real feast in your room. Speaking of which, breakfast is just that — with everything hot and cold you could desire, in addition to individual yogurts, sliced fruit and an array of breads. As with everything about this hotel, the dining room is quite spacious. So, again, is the Fitness Room (floor 1), with its free weights, two benches, endless machines and water dispenser. Diamond members may visit the ground floor lounge, with a 6:30 a.m. continental breakfast (although you are invited to bring your restaurant breakfast back here if you choose), evening cocktail/light fare reception 6-8 p.m., as well as all during the day non-alcoholic beverages and a variety of coffee selections. For those who want to utilize your hotel room's fantastic kitchen, there is a Sainsbury’s market just 2-3 blocks away and directly across the street from the hotel something called Farmfoods, which sells predominantly frozen foods (name it, if it’s sold in frozen packaging, it’s here). You honestly will never have seen this many frozen food items in one place. Hotel elevators are F1-speed fast (seriously). And the best tourist deal in town is the City Sightseeing Glasgow hop on/hop off bus (about $20 for a 2-day pass), which has 20+ stops to get you to everything in Glasgow. Thanks again to Euan and Andrew for making us feel special… in your very special hotel! American visitors will be amazed at how far, far superior the European DoubleTree is to ours at home.
29;Weekend break;Fabulous hotel and the guys in the exec lounge (Raymond & Ryan) really looked after us, they are a credit to the Hilton brand. We got upgraded to the 8th floor as a diamond member and the room was fabulous. Thanks for a great stay in Glasgow , we will return .
29;just what we needed;a short trip away from home to relax and enjoy Glasgow. picked here as its well located and has a nice bar. Staff super friendly, really well worth staying. The underground isn't far and the west end is a couple of stops away and has loads of brilliant bars and restaurants!
29;Leisure club so bad;Two night stay Rooms were great Main let down was the leisure club Changing rooms were disgustingly dirty, dirty floors walls lockers None of the hairdryers worked Toilet look like a bomb had went off in it, and hadn’t been cleaned ever Urinal cracked and showers out of order not that I’d had been able to get clean in them Pool slightly cleaner surprisingly but has multiple missing tiles resulting in debris on the bottom of the pool and sharp edges Left side of the pool if you are looking to fix these fyi) I wouldn’t let my dog swim here!
