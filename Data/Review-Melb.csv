"1";"";"This station has its fair share of problems. For one, the signage on which side of the platform you have to take in order to enter/leave the metropolitan area could be a lot clearer, especially on the two main paths to enter the station. Pedestrian access is also very poor, too many lights to cross the road with no protective barries making the journey a little risky if nearby traffic is busy. Disability access could also be improved greatly by updating the paths to make them more smoother and also providing a lift for people who take a while to travel up the ramp. Lastly, they have no electronic signage here telling you when the next train is and when the next train times are. You have to trust the slightly puzzling train timetable or just look at your phone.";

The drinks menu states a selection unique local and imported beers.  Unfortunately many of the local beers were not available, but I did get to try a nice raspberry beer.  There are large tables out the back, great for drinks with friends, or smaller tables for 2-4 people. The only downfall of the Council House 2 is the toilets. They were pretty messy with paper towels and urine on the floor.  They are also unisex, so I couldn't imagine they were very nice for women.  There are extra toilets located upstairs which fair a little better as they are less used. Certainly stop for a drop. If they could manage to keep their selection of local beers stocked up and keep the toilets cleans, this fashionable little place would be a winner.";

I highly recommend going in and taking a look if it is open. The upper floor interior provides a much better view of the church but is almost always locked and inaccessible. I have been up there as a kid as I attended this church for many years and the view on upper floor is amazing. <br><br>There are some famous Australian art works by Australian Artist Rupert Bunny notably The Prodigal Son and Abraham's Sacrifice.

Do check out the little old chapel at the back of the church too, it is really pretty and serene as well as the little rooms at the front of the church if they are not locked. You feel like you have gone back in time to Victorian England.<br><br>The magnificent organ inside the church is the first pipe organ in Melbourne and imported from England.

It is worth attending a Sunday worship just to hear the organ being played.<br><br>The church still has its original old wooden seats with old cushions and it is still being heated by metal pipes running along the bottom of the seats. Those old cushions have been around since I was attending church there in 1970s.<br><br>This is also one of the first Chinese Churches in Melbourne.

The fact that it is not always open for casual visitors may put you off, as may the presence of a few beggars and homeless people in the grounds. An adjacent building, the Princess Mary Club (a residential hostel for female students and workers until it closed in the 1970s), has scaffolding around it and is destined to be demolished so the church can co-operate with real estate developers to build a tower on that part of its land.<br>The interior of the church is atmospheric and there are a couple of significant paintings.

"8";"Free Lunchtime Concerts on Wednesdays";"Built between 1819 and 1824 by convict labour and designed by former-convict-turned-government -architect Francis Greenway, St James' Anglican Church is Australia s oldest church. <br>The first service was held on 6th January 1822, when the new colony not yet 50 years old.<br>If the architecture looks a little unusual that's because it was originally designed to be a courthouse. Macquarie's grand plans for an expansive public works programme came a bit unstuck when a London report found that it was all too expensive. Some buildings were cancelled or put on hold and the courthouse was converted to a church. The planned prison underneath the building became the crypt.<br>The most striking feature is the 52 metre tall copper steeple. However theft was another problem for Macqurie and when the spire was erected in 1824, the copper sheets were stamped with arrows to deter thieves (a constant problem in a penal colony).<br>St James is still an active church today with regular masses so it is open to the public to walk in.<br>On Wednesdays there are a free lunchtime concerts (donations accepted), starting around 1pm. I happened to wander past around this time and the doors were open so I took a seat up the back and enjoyed the last part of the concert.";

Plenty to interest inside with the stained-glass windows and various memorials and monuments. The church dates to 1819 and was consecrated in 1824. The building is a good example of Georgian architecture with an impressive portico fronting the West Street entry. It unfortunate that the church is surrounded by higher buildings.

Of the two, we would recommend the Docklands cruise as it's much more interesting, taking in the Docklands area and the Port of Melbourne. The upriver part of the cruise goes past the Rod Laver tennis centre and Botanical Gardens but apart from that, there wasn't much to see. Captain Dave kept us informed of all the sights worth seeing. <br><br>Our only complaint was on the second hour of the cruise was the screaming kids that boarded with there parents. Maybe we are getting old but letting your kids run riot to the detriment of other passengers is wrong.  The captain even had to tell one parent twice to not hang his kid out the window!";"Very enjoyable little trip";
"41";"Really enjoyed our cruise today. All the staff were very professional and the captain's commentary was entertaining and informative. The only downside was that the boat itself could do with a little tlc on the interior: scruffy paint and a smell of rubber.";"Great cruise to get a different view or Melbourne";
"41";"We did the 60 minute cruise out to the Port of Melbourne. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable and it felt a good balance of commentary.  Due to the tide, we had to wait for a later cruise as the cruise we had booked on changed to go the other way up the river.  We had already explored in the direction of the cricket ground and Botanical Gardens so wanted to make sure we saw the Port and Docklands. The boat is clean and comfortable. Definitely a must do whilst visiting Melbourne for the first time.";"Just okay";
"41";"We did the 1 hour cruise.  It was very noisy - lots of people talking while the captain was commentating.  We got on at the second stop so the seats were limited (all window seats were taken).  The inside of the boat needs a renovation.  There was no coffee or tea on board like mentioned by the ticket seller.  This cruise was very under whelming.  I wouldn't recommend it or do it again.";"Very misleading and disappointing";
"41";"After paying for a one hour cruise we were told on board that we couldn't go upstream or downstream due to various issues and we would just be circling around a small part of the river.

Also, why is it in US dollars, I nearly had a fit when I saw the amount changed on my account?<br>Second tour downstream was better. Boat larger and cleaner, skipper nicer but commentary a bit hard to understand as it was muffled. The young blonde lady deckhand who served the coffee was excellent. She was friendly towards myself and grandson. 5 stars for her!";"Horrible Organization";
"41";"Horrible experience, terrible organization, 2 boat captains were arguing whether or not the boat would fit under the bridge so with a boat full with 80 people they decided to try it and we almost got stuck under the bridge (see picture).  I paid $35aud for a tour and they only refunded me $10 saying I got half of the tour so I find it unacceptable to be gambling like that with the safety and time of so many people.";"Great river cruise";

By the way, the grassy patch near the Royal Children's Hospital is good  for kite flying.";

"44";"Historically Interesting";"One would not normally visit a cemetery as a place of interest but as a long-time resident of Melbourne I had never been and therefore a reason to go. Dating back to 1852 this large (43 HA) cemetery is the resting place or memorial  of many famous people and four Prime Ministers. Three things were prominent. The first was the elaborate memorial to many families, particularly Italian, the second the dilapidated state of many of the graves, many moved by tree roots or just left un-cared for and the third, the division or religions  across the cemetery.There are many historic buildings and some quirky memorials as well including the one to Elvis.";

His grave is here along with some of those who took his land.";

They include European pioneer graves back to 1870 or so and some famous Victorians from later periods. Derrimut an Aboriginal leader of the district is here, too. Graves for many nationalities and religions show much of the multiple cultures and languages of Melbourne. The office is helpful with searches of records if there is a specific grave you are seeking.";

It is a must for Australian history buffs. The cemetery is open every day to the public.  <br><br>Getting there: take trams 19 if coming from Elizabeth St CBD or 1 or 6 if from Swanston St.  Get off when you come to the end of Melbourne University's residential colleges.  Then walk around 2-5 minutes to the main entrance with the blue stone Building Gatehouse.<br><br>What to see:  I recommend picking up a free cemetery map and self guided tour from the Gatehouse and walking around. If you can't find the self guided tour pamphlet I have included it in my photos on tripadvisor and you can read of there.<br><br>Highlights include:<br>- Gatehouse museum to view old home, furniture, see the old original bell, see old furniture and colonial mourning costumers<br>- Elvis memorial<br>- Prime Minister's Garden where Robert Menzies, John Gorton, Malcom Fraser and Harold Holt are buried and the plagues wall to current and previous PMs<br>- see the old Rotunda where people use to have their picnics<br>- Burke and Wills monument<br>- Charles Hotham grave the governor that caused the Eureka Stockade<br>- Redmond Barry the guy who founded Melbourne Uni, State Library and sentenced Ned Kelly to death, and note the subtle plague to his mistress who is buried next to him<br>- Federici, the ghost who haunts Princess Theatre in Melbourne<br>- Mary Mckillop statue and Mausoleum, do take the lift underground and see the ultra modern underground mausoleum<br>- victims of the Holocaust Monument<br>- there are 8 Victorian premiers buried here, 1 Victorian Governor and 1 Governor General Issac Issacs and 90+ WW1 and WW2 veterans<br>- sandstone chapel in the middle of the cemetery<br>- or just meander through the different ethnic areas, there's a Jewish section, Greek, Chinese, Italian and then there's different areas for different denominations, roman catholic, Church of England, Methodist, Presbyterian<br>- my ancestor who came to the Bendigo gold rush is also buried here in the Chinese section<br><br>This cemetery is such an underrated free attraction for both locals and tourists.  If you are happy to pay for a guided tour with their very knowledgable and entertaining guide there are night and day tours around once a month and cost $15.";

Former Prime Ministers, Premiers, and even Saints (Sr Mary MacKillop's family are interred here).  Quite by chance, I found the grave of prolific Australian writer Marcus Clarke who was born in 1846 and died in 1881. There is a Bourke and Wills memorial and a very moving remembrance for the Holocaust.  I will go back to find more I know.";

The cemetery has loads of interesting features, including the Prime Ministers' Garden. It's a big place, so you will do some walking. The night tour is interesting.  By the way, unlike many other jurisdictions, in Victoria graves are eternal: they will never be reused. One of the most interesting graves is that of Walter Lindrum, which is shaped like a billiards table. Walter -- or Wally" -- Lindrum is an Australian legend. He was world professional billiards champion for many years.";

Otherwise this was a cool way to start off.<br>The gaol itself was self guided walk through and great insight at the old prison.";
"51";"Don't miss the Watch House experience";"We found the old city jail to be very interesting. There are three levels of cells, and most cells contain a story about a former inmate or the living conditions in the jail (which were horrible). They attempted to break the spirits of the prisoners through deprivation of contact with other people and the outside environment. People were jailed for being homeless. Fortunately this jail was last used in the 1920s. Be sure to catch the tour of the Watch House which is located next door to this prison and was used until the mid 1990s as the holding cells for all prisoners before they were charged/convicted. It is a small location that housed many men of various offenses in one group location (from drunk and disorderly all the way to murderers).";
"51";"Ghost Tour";"Did the Ghost Night Tour which was informative, interesting and fun, nothing spooky happened for us but we still enjoyed ourselves";
"51";"Expensive yet interesting";"This is better than Freemantle Gaol. There is a lot of detail with each of the exhibits, on the three floors of the jail. At $33 per adult, it is a little expensive, for what you get however. The scheduled tours of the adjoining police detention center, mitigates this somewhat. Some good information on Ned Kelly (his armor in in the Victoria State Library building nearby), the people who were hanged, and the handmen themselves (and the tools that they used!).";
"51";"Excellent tour";"We visited on our last day in the city before heading to the airport. The tour of the 'city watch house' is hilarious, as the guide assumes the character of a warder and treats the visitors like recently arrested ner do wells. After the tour you are free to explore the old gaol building. There is loads of historical information in the cells. An additional bonus for us is the reciprocal arrangement with Britains National Trust which recognises our membership, so free entry (normally $66 for 2). Thoroughly recommended.";

It is a long stretch of parks and walkways from the Yarra River down to the Botanical Gardens. It includes the Queen Victoria Gardens and Kings Domain with Govt. House, Sydney Myer Music Bowl, Shrine of Remembrance and lots of statuary of prominent people of the times. On a cool, overcast Sunday morning, the paths were very popular with runners and walkers. A real nice part of Melbourne for all to enjoy!";

The King's Domain ranges from the parklands  surrounding the Shrine of Remembrance  and the Sydney Myer Music Bowl. It also includes the area surrounding Government House and the region south of the Botanic Gardens. This expansive area is full of flower beds and mature trees. It's peppered with monuments and other fascinating features.";

We sat under a gorgeous lemon scented gum  and talked and played a leisurely game of cards with our adult kids. <br><br>The one that could be better is access to toilets and in particualr clean toilets. The toilets our son walked 10mins to get to were the worst he said he'd ever had the misfortune of having to use.

It's more notable for being  a return to the symetrical gardens of  England's Elizabethan  era. The garden was created in 1934. This secret garden is well worth taking a few minutes to find -- just follow the signposts. The garden is very calm and pleasant. The highlight is the pond, which leads to an  ivy-draped  grotto  sheltering  a water numph statue. My grandmother was brought up on a farm where there was never much of anything except hard work, so I appreciate this memorial to these pioneering women";

But when he falls madly in love with a young soprano, Christine, he devotes himself to fostering her talents, employing devious methods to ensure her success. <br><br>The music for the Phantom of the Opera is composed by an English composer and impresario of musical theatre, Andrew Lloyd Webber.

It also hosts seasons such as Chicago. Our son paid $100 each for us, but it was well worth it. I especially liked Alinta Chidzey as Velma Kelly and Natalie Bassingthwaite as Roxie Hart, two vamps in the great theatrical tradition of 'femmes fatale.' Jason Donavan was a standout as Billy Flynn. The State Theatre is a plush venue. The curtain is quite decorative..Get out early if you want a drink at intermission.";
"58";"World ranked research university";"The University of  Melbourne was founded  in 1853, at the height of the Great Australian Gold Rush. From these humble beginnings, the University has become one the world's highest-rated research institutions. Courses of study range  from science to languages and the arts. It's favoured by foreign students, who fit into  Melbourne's diverse culture.";
"58";"Start of the 8-hour day";"The  University of Melbourne is literally a sandstone university. The early parts of the University were built of sandstone, by hand, by stonemasons, In 1856, stonemasons working on the Melbourne University  site downed tools and marched into the city, gathering other workers on the way. At the Parliament of Victoria, they demanded an 8-hour day -- 8 hours work, 8 hours rest and 8 hours recreation. Their stoppage led to improved working conditions across the nation, and then across the world. The Great Australian Gold Rush led to a demand for labor, and the 1850s were a period great progress for working men. The Labour Day holiday commemorates this walkout.";
"58";"This university is serious about scholarship";"Sir Redmond Barry was an Anglo-Irish jurist who featured prominently in colonial Victoria's public life.. He was, amongst other things, first Chancellor of the University of Melbourne. It is notable that the University of Melbourne, while accepting large numbers of foreign students, has maintained high academic standards and adhered to the notion of academe. Described as a sandstone university, Melbourne has many buidlngs of historic worth. It is the second oldest univesrsity in Australia and the oldest in Victoria. The University of Melbourne has several campuses, but the main campus is in Parkville, just to the north of Melbourne's CBD..";
"58";"Its Residential Colleges Can Host Guests Too";"If you are a visitor to the University of Melbourne and if you are looking for a place to stay during your visit, a great choice can be one of the university's 10 residential colleges. Many of these have some apartments for hosting guests. You do pay a fee but it's a reasonable, especially if you plan to stay longer than a couple of days. I've stayed at Trinity College and University College twice each, with the most recent visit last week. The location is on campus, not far from many of the academic departments. You get to use most of a college's facilities, including its dining hall. During term time, you also get to meet with students over meals, and you may be invited to dine at the High Table for dinner.";
"58";"Sandstone university takes ideas seriously";"The University of Melbourne is rated as Australia's best university, and as one of the best universities  in the world. The older part has a lot of sandstone, but the new buildings are an architectural hotch-potch. The new Design Building is quite stunning, it's worth a look. The university has several places to eat, including a bar. The University of Melbourne is officially located in Parkville, though most people would say that it's Carlton. Trams heading north on Swanston Street usually terminate at the campus..Being a student is  hard work, several pubs near the campus have shut because students don't have time to have fun. As a graduate of the University, I can say that the University of Melbourne takes the notion of 'academe' very seriously and it is a sanctuary for the free exchange of views and ideas. The Potter Gallery is associated with the univerity, it's not very large, but it is interesting.";
"58";"Sandstone";"In the USA they refer to the Ivy League universities, while in Australia the oldest universities are referred to as the Sandstone universities. The University of Melbourne is one of the few. There are many architectural styles in use and entry is unrestricted. There are a number of dining facilities available. Some of the buildings and colleges date back about 130-150 years. I especially like the Law Quadrangle, the Old Arts, and the Old Pathology buildings.";

I later saw one, I had prev seen outside the library skating, yelling at people, smash a glass atm in China town with his skateboard . Hopefully they have cameras. He was quite terrifying .

The Regent is one of Melbourne's most popular theatres, and it has remained in almost constant use since it was built.

While the Narrator played a good role and has a great voice, the casting of children in adult roles left me  choking. There was a 9 year old Asian girl playing an adult Jewish man. I mean come on, as a previous reviewer asked (and the guy seated behind me!), was there not enough money for an adult cast? The narrator which is a pivotal role played other roles which just didn't succeed and took away from the production. It is insanity how bad this version of Joseph is, the benchmark being the version that played in Melbourne 2-3 decades ago and which lives on in my memory for its greatness. Shane Crawford is definitely not the worst person cast in this show and as a Melbournian, he worked. I was planning to see Joseph a few times over summer as I love the music, thank God I didn't buy a second ticket yet. Kudos to the lead actor and to Paulini but forget the rest. For kids and philistines only.";

Very old and elegant, with its gold detailing and beautiful draping. <br><br>Production itself was mostly great. I'm all for a surprise celeb appearance for a laugh, but get someone who can sing. Sorry Shane, theatre isn't for you. Paulini was amazing as the narrator.";
"66";"Joseph and the Amazing Paulini";"I have seen this show five times, ranging from school productions to West End. Did they not have enough money for a full cast? The narrator was also Jacob, Mrs Potiphar, a Guard, and was jigging about and popping up at random moments throwing bad fake accents around for no discernible reason. All the music had been slowed down? Random vocal theatrics that added nothing to the show. The casting of a child as Potiphar'..with an over sexed wife? Yuck! Half the brothers were children, and they did a very good job, the grown brothers and female dancers were great. Shane Crawford looked scared out of his mind and had all the pizzazz of wet tofu. Where were the sets? Paid to see Joseph, got the Paulini show with some kids and a couple of good dance numbers. Really poor effort. If it ain't broke don't fix it comes to mind.";

It was decided that a Treasury Building, with vaults to hold tons of gold, was required. Had the massive vaults been filled, the value  would have been astronomical. Alas, the gold boom was tapering off by the time the Treasury Building was completed. Even so, the Treasury  Building remains one of Australia's finest buildings constructed in Renaissance style.

Now it houses some government offices, and acts as a functions venue as well as a museum exhibiting all sorts of items and information about the history of Melbourne and the state of Victoria in general. The most amazing exhibits are the original gold vaults where gold was meant to be stored during the gold rush era. However it is doubtful whether much gold was actually stored in the building, because by the time of its completion the gold rush was over! Also there are some rare and historic documents from Public Record Office Victoria that tell us some interesting moments about the history of Victoria. Entry is free.";

"68";"Beautiful Architecture";"The Old Treasury building is a beautiful example of Renaissance Revival architecture. The wealth from the Gold Rush fueled the construction, with the idea being to house the new found riches.

This Renaissance Revival building was constructed from 1858 to 1862. unfortunately, the torrent of gold flowing from the Great Austrlian Goldrush had declined to a trickle, and the the building took some time to complete. The Museum has a permanent display entitled  Melbourne: Foundations of a City. Currently, there' a temporary  exhibition entitled  Wayward Woman."'

Pretty sure they don't even have them and just pretend. Didn't see tigers (in either enclosure), dingoes, penguins, lions, koalas just to name a few. Elephants pens were all missing elephants but found two at the very end that you couldn't really see. The paths are long and drawn out. So much walking but so little animals. There is one tiny little view point for the gorilla and we only got to see his backside 'The giraffes were cool though!! also disappointing you can't even pet a kangaroo, every zoo has an open field to pet kangaroos. <br>Also the car park was a joke !!!!!! Drove around for half and hour before we were told to go and park at the sports field not even near the zoo.";"Worth to visit";

It's still smaller than international zoos, but has a great variety and great interactive displays for kids.

It reminded me of Singapore (my overall favourite zoo so far).";"Captivating Zoo animals will interest kids";

Now there are very windy pathways taking up the majority of your time and great enclosures with 1 or 2 animals to be seen if you're lucky. Walked over 6 kms but Sorry we were all disappointed for the price. Also went to buy a coffee at 2.45 but was told they had closed for the day.

There is not much of a museum, just one room with not much in it, a boring video and not enough seats.

It can include paintings, sculpture, ceramics and installations, among other things. Installations are common, although their intention can be obscure. Contemporary art is still establishing itself as a separate artitic genre. Now that the Modernists are firmly established as the paramount genre in Australian art, it will take some time for people to come to terms with Contemporary art, which can be confronting and confusing.";

The Australian Center for Contemporary  Art, known as ACCA, is known for its moving exhibitions of contemporary art, including movement and installations.

"85";"Art as you may not like it";"The Australian Centre for Contemporary Art (ACCA)  is a major art-space hosting exhibitions of contemporary art.. The current exhibition at ACCA is glass work by indigenous artist Yhonnie Scarce. The exhibition runs until mid-June 2021. Contemporary art is art that transcends Modern art. The ideas behind the exhibits sometimes need explanation.";
"85";"You will be shaken";"The Australian Centre for Contemporary Art is quite an amazing place. We don't always like contemporary art but the exhibition we saw in April 2021 was absolutely stunning in all senses of the word. It was focussed on the British nuclear testing in the 1950s and 1960s in the Woomera region of South Australia, and the devastating effects on the indigenous population. This is an absolute must see exhibition, by an Indigenous artist.";

Quiet around 10:30am so it was good to have space to wander. Guess it depends on who is showing at the time as we weren't particularly taken by Eva Rothschild's works. Still, staff are super friendly and kind helping to put our backpacks in lockers. Good selection of art books too, and sweet little coffee cart. Quick check off the list. Would be good to check who's on before heading over. Great building design.";
"85";"Great space - great exhibitions";"It's not all about the NGV! Just around the corner is the Australian Centre  for Contemporary Art or ACCA. It holds an important place in the Melbourne art world - in the Australian art scene. Artistic director Max Delaney and his creative team present exhibitions by both international and Australian artists. ACCA  also commissions new works and has a program of public talks and an education program for  teachers and students. <br><br>If you want pretty and easily digestible art (do you really?) then ACCA is perhaps not the place to visit. If you want to be challenged, moved, engaged, informed and sometimes  delighted then you will enjoy ACCA. <br><br>The building itself is beautiful as only rusted metal can be. Set on a bare sandy block it appears like an urban architectural reference to Uluru. The erstwhile controversial sculpture Vault (aka the Yellow Peril)  sits on the edge of the site in 'buttery' contrast to the red surfaces of ACCA itself. An exceptionally photogenic building especially its sharp edges against a clear blue Melbourne sky ( yes we do have them!). <br><br>ACCA has a modest bookshop and coffee cart (good coffee). Set aside at least an hour for a visit especially if you get a volunteer  who is totally  up to speed  with what is currently    showing. <br><br>On now until 24 June 2018 is 'Dwelling Poetically: Mexico City, a case study'. A rich collection of works by 12 artists who have a connection to Mexico City. Well worth a visit!";
"85";"Takes itself a bit too seriously....";"I like the fact that ACCA exists, and that it has a very specific mandate. From the outside, the architecture comprises a minimalist iron superstructure (which can appear imposing and rather unwelcome), but this does mean very large and airy exhibition spaces inside. The art is a mixed bag - I have been enthralled and appalled in equal measure, depending on the current exhibitions. Maybe that's what contemporary art is supposed to be about (no fence sitting), but at times the choice of work is simply designed to irritate. worse, the selections suggest that the curators are guilty of tokenism, or only include worthy work. It can all feel very po-faced and devoid of humour. So, do your research on the exhibits before heading over.";
"85";"unique";"I saw the Berlinde De Bruyckere show (which was the only thing here - this museum doesn't seem to have a permanent collection), I really loved it - it was really different from anything I've seen before, it's slightly shocking but it's thoughtful too (unlike - in my opinion - a lot of contemporary art).<br>Entry is free, the 'price' is the very long walk from the cbd - I think it's very worthwhile if you like art and have a free hour in Melbourne. Be sure to check the website for opening hours, a few years ago I walked all the way here and found it closed!";

The production is true to the novel more so than the mini series was. There a couple of wow moments so no spoilers, it is a production not to be missed. My husband is not familiar with the story and was a little lost at times but he thoroughly enjoyed it as well. So even if you have not read the book - still go.

Very different to hear an opera with three baritones, one tenor (who was definitely not the hero), and two marvellous sopranos. Original, unusual music by a small chamber orchestra making dramatic sound effects at appropriate times. An amazing set, giving an x-ray image of domestic life and exposing the disintegration of normal family relations in the face of Gregor Samsa's tragic break-down. Simon Lobelson's performance as Gregor was simply astonishing, combining marvellous singing, convincing acting and extraordinary physicality as he metamorphosed from human form into something else.";

The Malthouse hosts live theatre, and it's a popular venue during Melbourne's Comedy Festival.

The Malthouse Theatre is near the National Gallery of Victoria (NGV),it's  not far from St Kila Road. Parking at night is OK, but getting the tram down St Kilda Road may be easier.";

They have a wonderful troop of actors who always give a wonderful performance.  The concerts we have attended were extremely satisfying.  There is not a bad seat in the house and the VFAC has been great in obtaining some very good performers. Thank you Victoria FIne Arts Center.";

"88";"A True Gem for the Community";"We have been in the Fine Arts Center for concerts, comedy, and symphony. Our most recent visit was the Three Dog Night Valentine's Day concert. There is truly not a bad seat in the house. The aisles between the seats are rather narrow for letting people into their seats, but otherwise a great place that is a truly great addition for Victoria, TX.";
"89";"Legacy of the past";"The Parliament of Victoria in Melbourne conducts guided tours on hourly basis from 9.30am onwards. They are highly informative. The two houses in red and green colours, the statue of Victoria and the story behind it, the old offices in the basement, the the new offices, library, canteen all have a story which is beautifully explained by the guide. We additionally enjoyed roleplay by school children.";
"89";"Playing a role in Australia's history";"The Parliament of Australia is an ornate colonial-era  building. From 1901 to 1927 it housed the Commonwealth Parliament, before the Commonwealth Parliament moved to Canberra. The Parliament of Victoria has many interesting nooks and crannies, including the fireplace in the  roof when the Founding Fathers would boil the billy and spin a yarn. The Parliament of Victoria is an impressive building, well worth spending an hour or so to take a guided tour.";
"89";"with a grand colonnaded front";"When walking down Spring Street on my way from Charlton Gardens towards Fitzroy Gardens my eye was caught by the Parliament House, of which is said that it is the largest 19th century building in Australia. Especially impressive is the grand colonnaded front, built of sandstone, although when passing by a lot was fenced off due to restauration work and one part was covered in scaffolding.<br><br>Reading about it I learned that construction goes back to 1855, but that work on the House continued for the follwing decades with the neoclassical colonnade only being added towards the end of the 19th century. There had apparently even been plans for a dome in the middle, which for financial reasons was never built. The Parliament of the State of Victoria can be visited with free guided tours lasting about 45 minutes.";
"89";"Grand example of colonial architecture";"The Parliament of Victoria is one of Australia's proudest legacies of the Great Australian Gold Rush, when Melbourne was the wealthiest city on Earth. The neo-classical building has yet to be completed, as funds were exhausted. Recently, the exterior of the Parliament has been extensively cleaned and refurbished. Visits to the Parliament are conducted regularly when the Parliament is not sitting. This heritage building is a grand example of colonial architecture. Entry is free.";
"89";"State Parliament Building";"My wife and I visited this place and went on a guided tour to see the various rooms inside this Stately and Opulent building. <br><br>It was just the two of us on the tour, as it was midweek and 9:30 am when we visited. Very good for social distancing. <br><br>There is some construction work going on, as a new extension to the building is being built.<br><br>The architecture is magnificent and the quality of the premises is excellent.";
"89";"Impressive Parliament building";"The Parliament House of Victoria is an impressive structure. It was built in the mid-19th century, starting in 1855, but apparently it has never been totally completed! Be that as it may it is of great architectural value and has been heritage listed. The building served as the first Federal Parliament of Australia from 1901 until 1927, when the permanent parliament building in the Australian capital, Canberra was ready. On the day of our visit the building was closed to the public for restoration works.";
"89";"The old parliament house";"A nice 19th century public building of Melbourne. It's not such a large and imposing building, but worth a quick visit. Visits are made regularly and need to be booked in advance. You can have nice views of downtown from the parliament steps.";
"89";"Well worth a visit and FREE";"Really interesting and beautiful place to visit. The Guide was excellent and very informative. It was great to be able to sit in the parliamentary chairs! Beautiful interiors.<br><br>The tour is free and lasts about 45 minutes.

"89";"Amazing Tour - A must for all";"Went on a tour of the Victorian Parliament and it was superb. The history, the GOLD, just being able to sit where our members of parliament make laws is really worth the effort of going on this 45 minute tour. Highly recommend. Just check before hand for times and availability.";
"89";"Interesting visit";"This is a short, 20 minute, free tour of the building with an informative guide with lots of facts and great presentation.i thoroughly enjoyed the tour and learnt a lot about the history building and the westminister parliamentary system. Highly recommended.";
"89";"20 minutes express tour";"We did the express tour organized by the Parliament House itself. It is interesting to see the two chambers and learn a little bit of how the government of Victoria works. Due to the nature of 'express tour' (20 minutes) there is too little time for explaining everything.";
"90";"Centre of Melbourne's civic culture";"The Town Hall lies at the heart of Melbourne's civic culture. It dates from the latter half  of the 19th century, when Melbourne was Marvellous. Amongst its many features, are the Visitor's Centre. The City Gallery hosts rotating exhibitions relating to Melbourne. The Town Hall has always been a centre for the perfoming arts. now it's a favourite venue for the annual Melbourne International Comedy Festival. Whether you can gain entrance to the main hall depends on what functions are in progress.";

Our guide Helly was brilliant - showing us various sites and sharing her personal passion for stories behind the sites and love for the city - oh and I think she is also secretly a chocolate/honey sales person LOL.    We had a lovely morning laughing learning and enjoying.  Thank you";
"90";"The centre of the City of Melbourne";"Melbourne Town Hall is a handsome civic building standing at the corner of Swanston St and Elizabeth St, one of the most prominent sites in the city. The Town Hall was constructed with the proceeds generated by the Great Australian Gold Rush, Apart from inspecting the Town Hall's lavish decorations, the City Gallery has interesting transient exhibitions. The Melbourne Visitor Hub is also a boon for travellers.";
"90";"Arduous to get a tour and it's boring";"We went on a free guided tour. The whole thing was a shambles from start to finish. You have to go through an arduous online form to request a tour and we heard no reply so just turned up anyway. Had to go to the information centre next door to book on a tour and they had spaces. You have to go through security, then leave your bag anyway, then fill out an online visitors form and get a pass. The whole thing is way more complicated than it needs to be. The tour guide was very nice, but the tour was terribly boring, way too much unnecessary info. Tour was an hour when it only needed to be 20 mins. Inside it is just a couple of old rooms, nothing special. Don't waste your time, go to the state parliament instead it's much better.";
"90";"Good lokking building";"Located on Swanson  Street this grand building dates back to the mid 18th century. The architectural features are impressive and as the Town Hall is surrounded by modern structures it really stands out. Good photo opportunity.";
"90";"A Christmas tradition";"Visiting the projections on Melbourne Town Hall is a Melbourne tradition and definitely worth a visit. It usually starts around 9pm and is easy to get to via tram. I recommend visiting the Myer windows nearby and also Fed Square.";
"90";"Impressive building.";"Melbourne Town Hall is a gorgeous Neoclassical  historical building constructed in the 1860's. Its located on the corner of Swanston and Collins Streets in the CBD. Its definitely worth a stroll around just to check out the architectural features.";
"90";"Great Christmas Illuminations";"One of the real bonuses in being in Melbourne just before Christmas are the illuminations on the Town Hall, the State Library and the Bridge over the Yarra just behind Flinders Street Station. If you are planning a trip make sure you include a trip down Swanston Street after dark just for these.";
"90";"Christmas Lights";"The Melbourne Town Hall is certainly decked out around Christmas time. We visited the Town Hall later in the night to view the light show projected onto its facade. Being a 'first-timer', I was entertained by the light show, which is on a rotation, although I suppose you can become jaded by that sort of thing. Well worth a visit.";
"90";"Lovely building";"Beautiful architecture! We are always drawn to such buildings everywhere we venture. We love the architecture, the looks are great. The Town Hall has been a feature of Melbourne city since the mid-19th century and it is likely to remain so for many decades to come! It is one of the sights any Melbourne visitor should see.";

The Friday opens till 9pm .. a great place you can buy a good price for all brands of apparels and shoes. Food court located inside if you are thirsty or hungry. A short walk outside leading to Crown casino that you can enjoy a good dinner after day of shopping. Great location and carpark charges can be crazy provided you did shop and get a free or discounts parking coupon from the stall! Enjoy shopping ..";
"92";"Warm and cozy. it's popular and busy.";"DFO  South Wharf is in the Southbank district. I went shopping there, it was warm and cozy when it was cold and windy outside. DFO is over several levels, it's popular and busy. There are lots of specialty stores, many appealing to young people, such as shops selling athletic footwear. Whether you find any bargains depends on how hard you look.";
"92";"Direct Factory Outlets";"My wife and I visited this place to do some shopping, after visiting The Lume at The Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Building located next to this place.<br><br>This place is a shopper's paradise with all the top brands being represented with shops. The shops include Kathmandu, The North Face, Columbia, Macpac, Nike, Adidas, Asics, Fila, Guess, Calvin Klein, Polo Ralph Lauren, Merrell (hiking shoes), Samsonite, Coach, Lindt, Cotton On, etc.<br><br>Prices are very good when being sold as clearance items and factory outlet discounts. We bought a few items and spent a few hundred dollars.";
"92";"Great Outlet Selections Under One Roof";"Unlike many outlet stores in other places where shops are usually scattered over a fairly large area, I like visiting DFO South Wharf cos everything is indoor. <br><br>Ample parking space but can be quite expensive ($48) if you stay for more than 3 hours. However if you buy something from the shops, you can get a 50% discount on parking. Option: You can choose to park at Crown's Multi Level carpark (on weekdays) which cost only $9 for up to 7 hours and have a nice stroll over. <br><br>There's a food court inside the centre and i found a very nice vietnamese restaurant - Signature Pho Viet worth trying. There's also a Lindt store serving yummy hot chocolates! <br><br>I gave it a 4 star rating because it doesn't have some popular brands like Hugo Boss,  Gap or Ralph Lauren.";
"92";"Great place to shop for fashions";"DFO South Wharf has a great variety of fashions, handbags, footwear, sportswear and more, all under one roof. Prices are up to 70 percent off normal retail prices. There's lots of window shopping. There's a great range of top local and international brands. DFO South Wharf is in easy walking distance on the Crown Entertainment Complex.";
"92";"Shopping";"I went specifically to visit Rivers. According to the website the business was still at the Southbank DFO but I searched in vain so it was a wasted trip. The website needs to match the floor plan directory please so visits can be accurately planned. The other shops were great and we enjoyed the food court. The selection was fantastic and the seating adequate for the number of people wanting food at that time.";
"92";"Sports apparels.";"I mentioned in another mall that that is my recommendation for sports apparel, this is another one and it has even more brands. Spend about three hours here but I think we only covered half the number of shops. I prefer this place to some of the malls as there is heaps of space and you don't get bumped around. Price wise I'm not so sure, but there's definitely a lot of major brands here. There's also a skateboard shop at the basement. And when you need to refuel, there's a big food court in the basement as well.";
"92";"If you love shopping and love bargains, DFO Southbank is the place to go.";"After many shopping trips to Melbourne I finally visited DFO Southbank. And was not disappointed!<br><br>From Surf shops to Designer label, my favourite being Guess, DFO Southbank had it all. <br>A food court for a much needed recharge, great variety of foods.<br>Staff at each store were friendly and helpful, something I always watch for. Many a friendly chat, and just really nice staff.<br>Centre itself was clean, and the only reason I left when I did, not enough arms to carry bags.<br><br>Next trip to Melbourne, I will definitely spend more time there, as I also missed many stores, and take my partner so he can carry just as much as me.";

"93";"What about the Queen?";"These wonderful gardens provide, by far, the best natural view of the city of Melbourne. However. I have problems with the statue. the fact that Queen Victoria did nothing, dressed in widow's weeds, but mourn her husband for 40 years. Prince Albert really was the Victorian Age, Sorry, in those days, the Queen could be nutty and get away with it. She wouldn't have   got away with 40 years of sulking today, Queen Victoria's actions (or inactions) were a dereliction of duty.";
"93";"Highest point of Queen Victoria Gardens";"The statue of Queen Victoria is made of marble and granite. It commemorates Queen Victoia, who reigned from 1837 to 1901. The statue is the highest point of the Queen Victoria Gardens, which extend to 4.8 ha (12 acres). The gardens also include the much-loved floral clock. The gardens also include an equestrian statue of her son and successor,  Edward VII. Unfortunately, the gardens are often neglected by visitors, as the view across the city of Melbourne is unmatched.";
"93";"Stunning Gardens";"Queen Victoria Gardens is yet another beautiful sight Melbourne has to offer. It's just another wonderful Garden of which Melbourne has plenty. These Gardens are stunning, with water features, sculptures, statues, like the beautiful monument to Queen Victoria and much  more. These Gardens are on St Kilda Road, and just a few steps away, in fact opposite the National Gallery of Victoria. The area here is full of Gardens and you would need a full day to enjoy at least a couple of them. Not to be missed.";
"93";"Beautiful gardens";"Yet another lovely garden in Melbourne- wow, you're spoilt for choice in Melbourne.  Opposite the Arts Centre the gardens are a very short walk from Flinders Street station- the tram also runs past.  Great spot to relax and enjoy some greenery in the CBD.  Some nice sculputres/ statues scattered around. <br><br>'Swelltraveller67' wrote a fabulous review so I'll direct you there for specifics. <br><br>These gardens, along with all the city gardens, are well cared for and well maintained all year round.";
"93";"Interesting place for a stroll";"Queen Victoria Garden is full of interesting sights. A statue of the woman who gave her name to an age looks out over the City of Melbourne. The small  waterfall is hidden away, but it's worth finding. In the pond, a bronze frog crafted by prominent artist John Olsen leaps out, adding a touch of whimsy. The pond is also favoured garden's duck. Queen Victoria Garden is sometimes  overlooked, but it is beautifully presented.";
"93";"Gardens deserve deserve to be better known";"Queen Victoria reigned from 1837 - 1901, giving her name to the Victorian era and the State of Victoria, amongst other things. She is little recognised today. The Victoria Gardens have one of the best aspects  of the city, from a prominent location looking out over central Melbourne. The granite and marble statue was unveiled in 1920. The garden is 4.8 ha (12 acres), bounded by St Kilda Road, Alexandra Ave and Linlithgow Ave. Victoria spent most of her later reign dressed in mourning for her beloved Prince Albert. These gardens are truly marvellous, they should be better known.";

"93";"Autumnal Colurs abound!";"A perfect destination to visit on a bracingly cold, sunny winters day, when the leaves are falling and pathways are scattered with autumn colours. Great walkways wind throughout the parklands with lakes and waterways, interesting sculptures, seating and play areas for children, making this a wonderful attraction almost in the centre of the city. So easy to access, running alongside the Yarra River, and just across St Kilda Rd from the National Gallery of Victoria.<br>Take time out and enjoy the tranquil setting of these fabulous gardens.";
"93";"Great to visit any time of the year - find the hidden treasures";"The Queen Victoria Gardens if seen from above, are a triangular formation and many tourists confuse these gardens with The Domain and Alexandra Gardens, but they are all separate areas, despite being part of the Domain Parklands. They run along St Kilda Road and around to the Art Centre. <br><br>During the COVID-19 restrictions [still current but lifting slowly] my daily walk extends to these areas. Areas I had not had the time to explore until now. There are some hidden treasures inside these gardens in the form of treelined pathways and some incredible monuments and sculptures, which I will write about today. <br><br>Since I was little when we came to the city we would head to the Floral Clock [which is operational] to see what designs and flowers were being used at that time. Right now they have made the word 'Melbourne' with some pansies and other flowers and small plants around it. Worth a having a look as it changes during the different seasons. [2 photos below] <br><br>Behind it is the King Edward VII monument and if you continue on you will come to a rotunda named afterJanet Lady Clarke. This area is popular for weddings and as restrictions are slowly being lifted, currently houses small groups for PT sessions. <br><br>If you continue around the path you will come upon a majestic monument dedicated to Queen Victoria opened in 1907. It shows the Queen in various poses. The whole area is immaculately cared for and you can see gardeners regularly cleaning paths, raking leaves, cleaning the ornamental ponds, pruning trees and bushes etc. <br><br>This area is part of the Melbourne City Walks - the sculptures and worth doing. As you enter the gardens from the St Kilda Road / Bridge entrance you are greeted by 2 busts of Apollo and Hercules [1780 - artists unknown] - though they have become a little battered and vandalised over the years, they still are in very good shape, even with the nose jobs! [You will understand when you look at them up close].<br><br>From there you can spend some time hunting for the sculptures: <br>[I have photographed them below]<br>Tom Bass's 'The Genie' - 1973<br>Paul Montford 'The Water Nymph' - 1920, <br>Yrsa Von Leister's 'The Phoenix' -  1973<br>John Edward Robinson's 'Water Children'- 1970<br>John Olsen's 'The Frog' - 2015<br>John Edward Robinson's 'The Path Finder [Hammer Thrower]' - 1974<br><br>As you are looking for these pieces of art you will be walking along lovely, winding paths surrounded by trees, flowers etc and even some ornamental ponds complete with ducks, geese and other water fowls. There are plenty of places to seat yourself and mediate, take your coffee to, read a book, exercise, photograph and improve your overall wellbeing. <br><br>You can get to these areas by car, though parking isn't cheap, or you can take a train to Flinders Street Station and walk down - 7mins max or take the tram and stop off outside the Art Centre or National Gallery and cross the road.<br><br>I love these gardens and never tire of their always changing beauty. I usually spend about 30-60mins walking around them - especially for photography / exercise.";
"93";"Suprised by lots to see";"Somewhat lost in the surrounding gardens that are Domain Gardens,Shrine and Botanical Gardens. These gardens are easy to access (first tram stop over Princes Bridge).. lots to see including the Floral Clock,Janet Clark Rotunda and Queen Victoria Memorial. Plus a lovely little pond. Great views of the CBD as well.<br><br>TIP: easy walk from CBD and return under the Princes Bridge to Southbank (lift currently unavailable at Hamer Hall)";
"94";"A venue for all seasons and events";"In 1959 the Sidney Myer Music Bowl was opened. Donated to the people of Melbourne by the Myer family, who were synonymous with the store chain in Australia, is a popular venue for concerts, opera, other events, plays and Carols By Candlelight - a yearly tradition enjoyed by young and old. <br><br>This unique sound shell music bowl/structure allows for excellent sound quality and is worth a walk around to admire the construction. The public to buy a seat [2000] or general admission tickets [11,000 capacity] to shows and bring their blankets and chair, some food and sit on the grassed area. <br><br>When not being used for shows it is open for the public to walk/jog through [except the stage/seating areas] as it is part of the Domain Gardens, the Arts precinct and close to the Yarra River and other tourists and sporting venues.<br><br>Within its confines, there is a range of sculptures, including a memorial to Sidney Myer and murals by local artists. An exciting place to photograph with the city skyline in the background. Places to sit around it and a lovely pond with the occasional ducks are nearby. <br><br>A place for all, any time of year.";
"94";"Music Bowl a gift to people of Australia";"The Sidney Myer Music Bowl is an Australian landmark. Sidney Myer (1878-1934) was a wealthy businessman and noted  philanthropist. The Music Bowl was his gift to the people of  Australia. The Bowl has been the heart and soul of music in Melbourne for many years. Now that the Corona virus lockdown is no more, we can expect many more events at the Music Bowl.";

These days, the Myer Music Bowl is best-known for Vision Australia's Carols by Candlelight, one of the highlights of the festive season. A series of free orchestral concerts is also planned this year.";
"94";"Terrible, left after 15 minutes couldn't hear the band";"Went to see Crowded House on Friday 8 April. The venue was overcrowded, there was absolutely no room to sit or stand on the lawn opposite stage - 1.5 hours before the concert started. Clearly the tickets had been oversold. We sat on the side of the hill and could not hear Crowded House - it was extremely muffled and we ended up leaving after the first two songs in disbelief. We spent $600 on tickets and they were completely wasted. I have been to various concerts at Sidney Myer Music bowl that were amazing, clearly there was an issue on the night that was unresolved. We spoke to one of the groundsmen outside the venue who also agreed that the sound was faulty and he had noted that during the sound check the sound was poor. So clearly there was a problem here on the night and Sidney Myer Music Bowl and Ticketek should be providing a full refund as we didn't get to hear anything. They should also be extremely mindful of the amount of people they are letting in as clearly this was oversold and that destroys the quality of the experience for everyone.";
"94";"It rained, and it was still great";"I went to The xx concert here, and had lawn tickets (so you essentially stand on a hill behind the seating).<br><br>I was extremely nervous prior to going that it wouldn't be a good experience - I wouldn't be able to see, I wouldn't be able to hear.<br><br>However, we very easily found a spot to stand and could have gone higher up the hill for a better view if we wanted. They had giant screens hanging from the roof that you could see if someone tall stood in front of you. And the sound was actually really good - I would be happy to stand anywhere in the venue, as we walked around a little bit and it was clear from wherever we stood. <br><br>There were great food trucks up on the hill, and we saw a few people who had prepared a picnic and were sitting during the earlier acts (such a good idea - will definitely do this at some point). <br><br>And as for standing outside - it rained EXTREMELY hard. We thought we were being hailed on at one point. But no matter how heavy the rain got we could still hear, and it had a bit of a festival vibe with everyone in ponchos having a good time anyway. <br><br>Definitely would go here again - all my worries were totally relieved.";
"94";"Great sound";"A amazing sound and atmosphere can be have here. The sounds are out of this world and a real chill. great place to visit at concert";
"94";"Great space";"Saw the Kylie Golden Tour concert this week and loved it. The Sidney Myer Music Bowl is an open air concert area near St Kilda Road in Melbourne, AU.<br>We bought early entry tickets and paid an extra $50 per ticket, so it would be good if they had a cordoned off area for our ticket type as people that did not line up early pushed down to the front barrier, which is unfair. They should also have an ''aisle'' area set up as there were so many people on the grass hill that is was nearly impossible to get through the crowds to go to the toilet or food trucks. <br>Not a great space to take children.";
"94";"Great FREE outdoor concert";"Had a blast recently enjoying a free opera open air concert and eating our picnic dinner. The sloping lawn gave a good view onto the stage and acoustics not too bad.<br><br>Most importantly the toilets and food/drink trucks were nearby. Security presence was also noted and appreciated.<br><br>Love to come back here again for more.";

"95";"Great exhibition for limited patrons";"The exhibition, She-oak and Sunlight, is a wonderful collection of some of our earlier artists' finest work, and I would recommend a viewing. However, I am not sure that the NGV have mastered the Covid control requirements for acceptable number of persons in a controlled  space. We booked for the 10.15am viewing. Bookings are spaced 15 minutes apart, I do not know how many people are allowed in at each booking,  but as there was no time limit or structured route through the exhibition, by 11.30 the gallery was really crowded and felt uncomfortable. Patrons were not counted out, so there did not appear to be a check on number of patrons in the venue at any one time.";
"95";"Great Art Collection";"I last visited this museum 3 years ago. Although the museum is free you still have to book your tickets online due to Covid restrictions.<br>I was disappointed as some of the main galleries were close so I could not show him some important artworks.<br>Pick up a floor map as there are lots of rooms which are round nooks, so that way you will be able to see everything on display.<br>If you have young children be careful with the Ivan Durrant display, as the painting of the cows etc are beautiful but the butchered pig heads are rather distressing.";
"95";"Always worth a visit";"This is a very accessible spread over 3 floors. It's probably best seen starting at the top and working down. It usually has special exhibitions, the current Ron Muscek exhibition and video, and the advertising agencies 'pitches' on creativity are both really interesting. The other floors contain excellent modern Australian art and photography and excellent aboriginal art. It's pleasing to see Australia's impressionist master, John Russell represented<br>If you are interested in art you need to set aside a few hours to do the gallery justice";
"95";"Waste of space and time";"It is hard to review this gallery, given some of the great galleries in Australia.<br><br>Firstly, it's mostly empty. Following on the heels of the mostly empty museum, the NGV has one closed floor. half of the ground floor 'Opening Soon' and lots of nothing on the other two floors. <br><br>Secondly, getting in is a trial. Checkin, scans, QR codes, second checkin, third checkin (no, I'm not kidding, we had to show our certificates and check in three times). The main door was not operating, so we had to get in through the side door. <br><br>Thirdly, the cafe charged us $44 for two coffee, two scones and a coke (small size can). <br><br>However, the few works on display were interesting and all were very new (mostly 2021). <br><br>Give it a shot. it's free, which is the best thing that can be said about it.";

Even so, several people were walking around exercising and/or walking their dogs. A pleasant walk along the shore of the bay, enjoying the sea breeze, the landscape of the jetty and admiring the harmonious architecture of the buildings, which honors its environment and location. I imagine a pleasant walk also in the afternoon and at dusk in a warm atmosphere with restaurants and bars in full activity.";

Complete with bin and drinking fountain with waterfall for dogs. Important to note that the fountain is not protected from birds/droppings. Park is surrounded by residential homes, so just show some respect in regards to noise. Unfortunately some people don't pick up after their dogs so be careful with droppings on grass. There are no car parks, only street parking.";
"106";"";"The park recently got upgraded and as far as I am concerned it is a downgrade. The playground equipment themselves are ok except for the climbing web, it is very loose. The play area is bordered with large boulders and is totally unsafe for little kids, especially when they are running around. Terribly unsafe. All the border rocks and boulders need to be removed.";

Hoping for a rare Rabbitohs win at the home of the Storm (with no such luck)! $50 per adult ticket quite steep when buying for a group of four plus a concession ($235). Nonetheless, great place to view a game from all areas of the stadium. You feel close to the action. Food is predictable with the usual mix of hot dogs, burgers and chips (plus a token salad sandwich). Beer expensive at $9-10 a schooner (though the young bloke serving referred to it as a pint). Stadium centrally located and easy to find for us out of towners! Good atmosphere - even with COVID restricted numbers.";

Live every game that I go to.";

Modern facilities. Easy to move around. Nice seating. Enjoyed the experience at AAMI Park in Melbourne. Can't wait for my next experience here.";
"107";"Very good sporting stadium for rugby and soccer fans";"The seating is close to the actual sporting ground allowing fans, especially on the ground level (Level 1), which is very close to the action.  Only down-fall is the roof doesn't cover the first 15 rows on the ground level.  Officially all rows, except the first 4 are classified as under-cover - this is not the case, as the rain never comes down directly.  The small capacity of 35,000 makes the atmosphere electric with crowds over 15,000.  My wife and I are Melbourne Storm fans and we have seats on Level 1 row O on the Eastern side and get soaked when raining, but being so close to the action counteracts getting wet.  Highly recommend seeing a Melbourne Storm game - great entertainment - does help to know a few of the rules (but usually someone is nearby willing to explain them to you).";

"110";"Great views of our city.";"We went on the Melbourne Star today while on a city sojourn. We weren't sure about opening times and bookings so I rang this morning to discover you can just show up which is what we did.  We lined up for tickets and then lined up to go on the wheel.<br>Considering there are restrictions in place due to Covid 19, the line progressed fairly quickly and we were on the Star within half an hour.  There was hand sanitiser everywhere and people were urged to keep 1.5 metres apart.  There were only 5 in our cabin on the wheel.  <br>Getting on and off was quite simple and we are 65 and 72.  As the wheel rotates you are treated to various sights over 360degrees.  We were able to see where the Maribyrnong River enters into Victoria Harbour and enjoyed picking out various landmarks around the CBD.  We were amazed by the number of high rise buildings that have popped up in the last 10 years.  The wheel took just on half an hour to go through the whole rotation.<br>I'd recommend it to all.";
"110";"Why didn't we do this sooner?";"We have resisted riding the Star ever since it was built. what a silly thing in a silly place. Yesterday we finally did it (using Scoopons - much cheaper!) and we loved it! The views (particularly as the sun set) were glorious. The three of us had a pod to ourselves which was good. <br>Could have been tempted by the second 'flight' for only $2!<br>Only thing that could have improved it is that the windows needed cleaning. Must be a hard big job!";
"110";"Great landmark in Melbourne";"Great place to view the Melbourne city.  The LED light display is fantastic.  I suggest to go up just before sunset.  The management of the queue should have been better.  I had to go the end of the queue after showing my online purchased ticket and wasted at least another 15 minutes.";
"110";"Not worth it";"After being on various different observation wheels/ observation buildings this one was a massive disappointment. The observation wheel it's self is on the edge of the city, when you see it in person you can tell instantly it is in the wrong location. When we first got there, after expecting it to be rather busy, we were the only people there. We had already pre booked our tickets online, therefore went straight through no hassle to join a queue of 5 people (they were all part of the same group, to which we ended up sharing a carriage with). We had to wait no longer than 2 minutes before getting into a carriage. As there were only 7 of us in a carriage there were plenty of space for us all to move around or sit down if you wish to. As the carriage is moving there is a record playing pointing out certain landmarks and certain views to look out for. I think this is a great idea as you know more history/information on what you are actually looking at. However as we were not the only people in the carriage and were sharing with 2 very small children, you could not actually hear any of the commentary. As the wheel is located on the edge of the city, you can see a limited amount of things. Looking one way all you can see is shipping containers and roads and looking the other you can see skyscrapers, but not over them so you are limited to what you can see. As you can imagine with the dust and rain the city experiences, the glass was rather dirty and spectacled, which again limited to what you could actually see ruining the experience. The whole ride took around 30 minutes.";
"110";"Relaxing , Amazing Views";"This area is Amazing , walk up the ramp, to this incredible Wheel that doesn't stop.. Beautiful Big Glass Cabins with a Seat in the Middle . Goes so slow , looks like the wheel isnt moving , Very Relaxing  Sit or move around , to see every part of Melbourne and Beyond  But the Views as you get Higher are great. Takes 30 mins to get around . Loved it .. Suitable for all ages , Very safe .";
"110";"Not recommend to people who are concerned about their personal belongings might be lost";"I bought tickets for my family from overseas. We expected to see good views of the city and be respected. However, the experience was annoying to us:<br><br>First, we were asked to put our school bags into a big container at the entrance of the wheel. No staff look after the container, not secured at all, and it is at our own risk for any loss. I would not have bought the tickets if I knew this earlier. Our passport, wallet, travel documents are all in the bags, which left us very upset. <br><br>The other annoying part is that they forced us into a gondola with other people and there was nobody waiting behind us. Actually, there are only three groups of visitors at that particular time. The first group of 2 went on a gondola of their own. Why we had to squeeze with the second group?!  we wanted to board the next gondola, but a girl insisted we board the gondola or not board at all. The next and the subsequent gondolas remained completely empty.<br><br>We had to accept that but we were not happy at all.<br><br>Never again and not recommend to people who are concerned about their personal belongings might be lost during the 30mins travel on the wheel.";
"110";"ok....but Eureka skydeck is soooo much better";"The concept is good....however it is in completely the wrong place. The views from Eureka tower (or even the rialto) are far superior than those in the Melbourne wheel. the staff however were fantastic - but so they should be - hardly saw any customers there the whole time we visited so were probably desperate for any kind of human interaction! The shopping complex here is a bit tacky. TIP - only venture out here when it is not raining as it is quite open to the elements! 2nd TIP - go to eureka tower. it is much better! 3rd TIP - DO NOT GO IF YOU ARE FEARFUL OF HEIGHTS AS YOU DO GET A LIGHT UNSERCURE FEELING";
"110";"Wonderful Views and Great Commentary";"Whether it is raining or sunny it is worth taking the 35 tram to this land mark. Whilst on the tram pick up a leaflet which gives you a 20% discount on the star. It is easy to find and the staff are friendly and help.<br>You are not squashed into pods and it is likely there will be no more than a couple of people in your pod. There is seating, a map is provided and there is an excellent running commentary explaining and pointing out the views.<br>Well worth a visit.";

Maybe the view at night might be better as melbourne is such a pretty city coming home on a plane or via the freeway. In this location during the day... meh";
"110";"Poor service at booking office";"Our purchase of tickets was a nightmare. We were directed to line up, waited in line for 30 minutes to get the tickets,when directed to the booth, the girl on there told us we had to line up you know, we already had, and was directed to her by the security guard. We had discount vouchers which she refused to honour. On complaining, rudely said she would have to see,then after another wait of 10 minutes grudgingly gave it to us. We had maki tourist vouchers. We had no trouble with other venues, just this one.";

The Tower is a Monument to Migration and Aspirations. We wondered why they put it in such an out of the way place! There were some good views from the top, over the wetlands.<br>A pity about the encroachment of all the housing subdivisions in every direction.  <br>After walking to the tower we drove to the other part of the park, where the playground and toilets are. Not very exciting for us, but probably good for families on a sunny day, which we did not have!";

I too k my family off 5 to the point cook coastal park in point cook Victoria as my employers have provided acomadation in the area and it is so nice n green n nice lakes everywhere. We started off by taking In the scenery at the park and had a lovely walk to the beach and took in a the buyetyful surroundings such as nature life, we spent the whole day at the park , my 3 young children had a lot of fun on the kids play areas and lots of space to run around and ride their bicycles. After all the fun we worked up a big appetite and we where able to cook on the barbeques that are provided free of charge. I was very impressed with the condition of the barbeques they where very clean and for a public area I believe they look just as good and clean as our kitchen at home so very impressive with the way Australia takes such good care of their parks and public amenities. The park also has many barbeques so there was no wait and the park provides very clean male and female toilets and very clean as well. We were greeted by someone that works at the park and wanted us to know we could ask for any advice or help without hesitating, and even cleaned our barbeque once we finished cooking. I found the whole experience of the park very satisfying as did my family. We have promised our children that we will spend the following weekend at this park again.I personaly can't wait and I can honestly say that anyone thinking of going to the point cook coastal park should not hesitate and just go and enjoy the day. The people are friendly and workers are very happy to help in any way to make your day as fun as possible. I GIve it a 10 out of  10 any day of the week.  Hope you all have as much fun as we did";

What a great park, lots of wide open space for kids to run free, BBQ areas and lots of parking.  We enjoyed some snacks on the beach looking out on the water and our son enjoyed the playground and exploring the beach.  The toilets weren't super clean and while signs advised visitors to pack our their garbage, many obviously didn't.  Well worth a visit if you are craving a quiet walk on the beach.";

Admission was $12 per adult with proceeds going towards a charity and from what we observed is run by volunteers,so that in itself gets our tick of approval. There is probably only 50 cars in the collection but they are very unique and beautifully restored and you can get up close and take photos. The cars are housed in the historical Queens Warehouse which was built in 1890's for the customs dept and the architecture and materials used in the building itself make it as rare and unique as some of the vehicles.

Never had to queue, must be getting old as they removed the cap off our purchased water bottles. Apparently could be used as a missile if thrown. <br><br>The female microphones staff member organising crowd control prior to entering did a fantastic job. <br><br>Definitely will be back to this venue.";
"120";"AO TENNIS";"The Rod Laver arena has padded seats, drink holders and more leg space than Margaret Court arena. The Australian Open tennis event attracts nearly 100,000 people per day. There is a terrible shortage of toilets and when you do find them, nearly all are down about 50 steps! It is not a user friendly venue for older people as the Melb arena is way over the back. Good luck getting into an outside court with a ground pass! I've been going to the January event since 1987 but after this year's experience, not in a hurry to return. The food quality is poor for the price you pay and mostly all fried and unhealthy. Drink prices not cheap either. Easier and better viewing to watch it on tv";
"120";"The man who won two Grand Slams";"Rod Laver won two tennis Grand Slams, in 1962 and 1969, and several Davis Cups. He was among the first professional tennis players. Rod Laver Arena is in the Melbourne Park complex, it's the main venue for the Australian Open tennis, the first Grand Slam event for the year. When it's freezinfg in the US and Europe, it's toasty in Australia. Rod Laver Arena is also a top venue for inteernational music acts. By the way, you can do a tour of Rod Laver Arena, it's open for inspection on Monday, Wednesday and Friday (closed hoildays) at 11:30 am, 1:00 pm and 2:30 pm.  You can get the tram from the CBD. it's an 15-minute easy walk..Rod Laver is an Australian champion. Australians love their sporting heroes.";

"123";"";"Came here to watch the tennis - was walking in and out as we swapped courts/arenas throughout the day. The arena has reserved seating sections as well as general seating. We only had general admission but no matter which seat we were capable of finding when we got back in, be it top level, or low level, we could always get a good view of the match. Sufficient toilets and food/drink stalls around the arena. The design is also such that you don't have to walk too far to get into the intended section should you have incorrectly entered through the wrong door. Reserved seating only accessible through the very top level though, but they do have lifts if you need. There's wheelchair friendly sections too. No drink holders on the seating unlike Rod Laver. Roof is retractable - I believe they usually have it closed, but it was half open for the match that day which was nice as you could feel the fresh air breeze. There was minor drizzling later that day but the roof stayed open. I imagine they would close it if it were pouring, so weather really wouldn't impact the ability for any event here to go forward. Big screens at each end to keep you up with scoring and live updates. Capacity limit is 10900.";

Lots of public transport option to and from.  Swan Road Richmond walking distance nearby for  pre show drink or after show.  Lots of food, drink and beverage options inside venue but pricing is hey.

Charcuterie boards, tasting platters, bao buns, French champagne, craft beer good grief.. I don't know about you but when I want gourmet food I don't go to an Arena to get it!

The ticket is only $15 for adults, and you can include other tickets for their exhibitions.<br><br>There is so much to see, but the most fun we had was in the Triceratops: Fate of the Dinosaurs and the Milarri Garden trail.<br><br>There were also the First Peoples. <br><br>Give yourself a couple of hours to go through everything. Must-visit.";
"124";"Triceratops- WOW - a REAL FOSSIL";"Triceratops exhibit. WOW, we were blown away by the exhibition. Most of the dinosaur exhibits are plaster casts, the Triceratops was a REAL 98% original fossil, only the back left foot and a tiny piece of the tail were casts. Found in Montana on private land in 2014, the dinosaur was purchased for $3M for the museum. We truly enjoyed the exhibition, as well as other area of the museum.";
"124";"Avoid Saturday Crowds";"We were not provided a map so we did not know the location or organization of the exhibit areas and sometimes the displays had an disorganized flow. We visited on a rainy, Saturday afternoon and there were throngs of children running all around. They pounded away on any interactive exhibit, making it harder for us to enjoy the museum. My wife especially enjoyed the forest display in the middle of the museum with its unusual birds and animals. The dinosaur exhibit area was also very interesting. We spent a little over 2 hours at this museum but on a quieter day, we would likely have stayed longer.";
"124";"Aboriginal Exhibit is worth a Visit";"First negative was having to pay to get in, which we are not used to coming from England.<br>Second was the cafe staff, who were inefficient  and incredibly slow, the cashier overcharged me for all 3 meals and i had to go back and get my money back. <br><br>The Aboriginal exhibit was very interesting and worth going to see, unfortunately a school party were in at the same time as us and behaved so badly that both myself and another visitor had to tell them on more than one occasion to stop running around and shouting. Eventually we found the teacher 'in charge' and asked her to do something about the behaviour as they were being incredibly disrespectful. <br><br>As a visitor from England, it brought home to me how little white history there is in Australia compared with the extensive history associated with the aboriginal tribes.";
"124";"Disappointing";"We booked tickets to Tyama and we're looking forward to it. We struggled to find a park so relented and paid the $18 weekend rate. We got entry to the museum with out tickets and enjoyed seeing Horridus the triceratops. The Greek exhibit was just ok. <br>We had high hopes for Tyama, but it sadly didn't live up to expectations. We went through in about 10 minutes finding it difficult to interact with the lighting displays. They weren't spectacular really. It started well, but we quickly realized it was pretty basic and we just moved through quickly and out. <br>Not worth the $30 entry price. The lume was leaps and bound better.";
"124";"Disappointing";"The Triceratops exhibition was good and the other dinosaur skeletons were interesting but the Greek exhibition was lacklustre, with lots of space taken up by a small number of exhibits and the information for each exhibit difficult to find. The whole area containing the mini mega model museum and Melbourne collections was closed off to visitors, but there was no signage to make visitors aware of that until they actually got to where the entrance to these exhibitions should be. I checked the website and there is no mention of any exhibitions being closed to the public at present. I would have been very angry if I had gone to the museum specifically to see these collections, only to find they were closed. <br>I thought the signage at the museum very poor. It was not clear to me where to find the widely advertised Triceratops exhibition, and I would have appreciated clear and more detailed descriptions of what could be seen in each exhibit.<br>The museum website has no FAQ section, no maps of the museum and no detailed description of what is available to see in each section of the museum. There is no information on the website regarding taking bags or backpacks into the museum, if there is a cloakroom or lockers to store bags while you explore the museum (there are lockers).<br>We planned to buy our lunch at a cafe at the museum. We are vegan. There was very little vegan food. We bought hot chips (which were lukewarm at best) but all the sandwiches and wraps contained cheese and/or meat. We were really disappointed at the lack of vegan options.+";
"124";"Must See - if you're interested in the history of the area";"Really enjoyed this museum, and I'd rate it as must see if you are interested in learning about the area. We took in two sections - one an exhibition on the history of the modern city, and the other an indigenous perspective. There were some other bits we didn't have time for, but those two were exactly what we'd hoped for. Recommend.";
"124";"Avoid";"Avoid the joint Museum/IMAX ticket. Website for booking tickets was very unclear and timings overlapped badly which meant ending up with barely 30 minutes in the museum after the film finished - and then being rushed out through the museum shop at closing time. These are very separate activities - I would definitely avoid combining them in one ticket. No time to look at the museum exhibitions in any detail. Really poor experience - would definitely not go back again.";
"124";"It's good but not the best";"Pricing is a big draw card for this museum. Free for children and $15 for adults makes this place very affordable for all families and a great spot to go during school holidays or wet weather days. <br>Although it has some great features such as the ongoing dinosaurs fossil exhibit and Australia history exhibit this museum is not one of the best around the world.<br>Lots of empty spaces which could be filled with more to see and do.";
"124";"WOW!";"This was a pleasant surprise. So much to see and do in this well designed museum. We learned a lot about the history of Melbourne in the process. The exhibits on Australia's bugs and poisonous 'things' was equally interesting.

"124";"Good not great";"Took 3 kids ( all under 10) after the insects and spiders etc, they got quickly bored. Needs more interactive stations in my opinion. There are some cool visual arts as you initially walk in ( a room on your left) with 4 walls of cool visuasl matched by chiiled music. The original people exhib was also good to educate the kids about. <br>I have scored it average which is a little harsh but i can't score it very good.";
"124";"Limited Time";"This is a big museum so with the restriction of only being allowed a 90 minute visit you have to decide which parts you are going to visit.

"125";"Premium seating - worth it!";"Whilst it is expensive, I'm really glad I booked premium seating. I was the only person in the row which made it very personal and comfortable. I saw Beauty and the Beast and it was nice to see it in 3D on the large screen. My only quibble is the price - $42 to see a movie is not something I would pay regularly but I decided to treat myself as I was on holiday.";

They made sure that I was aware of two large school groups coming to the session but advised that there was a section for the general public reserved at the back of the theatre.

I was hesitant at first to purchase tickets for 'As you Like it' simply because I was not already familiar with the plot line. Well, I am so glad I was not deterred by that fact! The show was lively, fast paced, delightfully funny, and beautifully staged. The performers are a actors, singers, and multi instrumentalists. I have seen shows before which were touted as showcasing such diversely capable performers but usually one aspect was sacrificed. Not so in this case. The Shakespearean script was used and slightly tweaked to make it engaging and well- paced. The inclusion of numerous Beatles songs was simply the icing on the cake. A joyful experience for the audience, to be sure. Just remember to arrive early enough to experience the wrestling. Yes, wrestling.";

"129";"Extremely poor acoustics, for blues";"I attended the concerts of both Beth Hart, and John Mayall, in the past week, sitting in row B (to side and near centre), on both occasions, and was so disappointed with the acoustics and/or the sound mixing. The listening experience was the worst I have had for some time. For example, in the later half of Beth Hart's performance, the guitar breaks were inaudible. John Mayall was clearly dissatisfied with the sound, and his keyboard was also very difficult to hear. My brother was in the middle of the circle for the second concert, and described feeling totally disconnected from the performance due to similar issues with the sound. Overall I felt it sounded like listening to music in a wooden box. Contrast this with wonderful sound quality for Paul Kelly's concert, that I attended last night in the Hamer Hall.<br>Perhaps the Recital Centre is suited to only a limited range of music. I will in future avoid concerts scheduled here.";
"129";"Great space for music, some issues";"This is a striking new-ish building that focuses on smaller musical assemblies than does the nearby main concert hall (Hamer Hall). Access, acoustics, but not seating reflect its newer construction. A great place for a recital. Music on offer can be classical, edgy, overseas, or items for teenagers/families.<br>I have attended ensemble and vocal recitals, school recital, and recently, Anh Do's personal audiovisual show about his life in Australia after arriving as a boat refugee (The Luckiest Refugee). All were largely enjoyable evenings.<br>My 13 y o son commented that he felt that the hall floor pitch should have been steeper as he and I sat behind several tall adults who kept moving side to side in their seats during the show. I could see around them by moving (not ideal), he could see much less. Seating is therefore disappointing for both him (smaller) and me (taller). Seat row spacing is tight if you are near 6 foot tall. There is no centre aisle so late comers accessing central seats are a disruption. Why are they are allowed in so late? So, if children are to attend, I suggest that you ask about clear line of sight seats, ? front of balcony seating. Booster seats for younger patrons, as available at any cinema complex, were not in evidence. Prices for some shows do not have chidren's prices. So a family friendly venue, on the face of it, seems to prefer oldies, just so long as they aren't near 6 feet tall.<br>The MRC has a website and e-newsletter service for your exploration.<br>You can have a moderately expensive drink at interval. Sadly pre-ordering did not seem to be available on the 3 times I attended.<br>Your can eat nearby but probably shouldn't. Eat in Prahran, South Yarra, or in the city.<br>Nicely done venue but need refining, so 4/5 stars at best in 2012 based on my 3 very different visits in the last 12 months.<br>I enjoyed each show but found the poor seating, prices, to be as frustrating as they are at the nearby Arts Centre. My teenage chidren like to attend clasical music events and are knowledgeable and quiet listeners. They tell me that they cant understand why they  don't seem really welcome. At least the acoustics are good.";
"129";"Go ASAP";"A visit here is fabulous. From the minute you walk in you know you are somewhere special.<br>The building it self is unique from the outside and very modern on the inside.<br>Once inside the auditorium you will marvel at the timber work and when the performance begins you will understand why the inside was designed this way. The acoustics are exceptional, even a novice will be able to tell the difference to other concert venues. A truly wonderful experience.";
"130";"Great exhibition for limited patrons";"The exhibition, She-oak and Sunlight, is a wonderful collection of some of our earlier artists' finest work, and I would recommend a viewing. However, I am not sure that the NGV have mastered the Covid control requirements for acceptable number of persons in a controlled  space. We booked for the 10.15am viewing. Bookings are spaced 15 minutes apart, I do not know how many people are allowed in at each booking,  but as there was no time limit or structured route through the exhibition, by 11.30 the gallery was really crowded and felt uncomfortable. Patrons were not counted out, so there did not appear to be a check on number of patrons in the venue at any one time.";
"130";"Great Art Collection";"I last visited this museum 3 years ago. Although the museum is free you still have to book your tickets online due to Covid restrictions.<br>I was disappointed as some of the main galleries were close so I could not show him some important artworks.<br>Pick up a floor map as there are lots of rooms which are round nooks, so that way you will be able to see everything on display.<br>If you have young children be careful with the Ivan Durrant display, as the painting of the cows etc are beautiful but the butchered pig heads are rather distressing.";
"130";"Always worth a visit";"This is a very accessible spread over 3 floors. It's probably best seen starting at the top and working down. It usually has special exhibitions, the current Ron Muscek exhibition and video, and the advertising agencies 'pitches' on creativity are both really interesting. The other floors contain excellent modern Australian art and photography and excellent aboriginal art. It's pleasing to see Australia's impressionist master, John Russell represented<br>If you are interested in art you need to set aside a few hours to do the gallery justice";
"130";"Waste of space and time";"It is hard to review this gallery, given some of the great galleries in Australia.<br><br>Firstly, it's mostly empty. Following on the heels of the mostly empty museum, the NGV has one closed floor. half of the ground floor 'Opening Soon' and lots of nothing on the other two floors. <br><br>Secondly, getting in is a trial. Checkin, scans, QR codes, second checkin, third checkin (no, I'm not kidding, we had to show our certificates and check in three times). The main door was not operating, so we had to get in through the side door. <br><br>Thirdly, the cafe charged us $44 for two coffee, two scones and a coke (small size can). <br><br>However, the few works on display were interesting and all were very new (mostly 2021). <br><br>Give it a shot. it's free, which is the best thing that can be said about it.";

The Australian Modernist paintings are quite beautiful, though I am not sure if including traditional Aboriginal artists is such a good idea. The inclusion of female artists in the canon", such as Margaret Preston and Grace Cossington-Smith is long overdue, although I was disappointed I could find nothing by Joy Hester.

"131";"Where is the organ ?";"This july 30th 2022 ...<br><br>It's many years since visiting this Concert Hall and I must say I was disappointed. <br><br>I found the Hall itself very boring in appearance. due in part to the disappearance of the organ and that sad brown cheap looking curtain at the back of the stage does nothing for me. The walls have been painted a very dark uninspired brown and the idea of being in a cave is no longer there.  <br><br>The staff behind the bars were obviously non professional, probably casuals due to the Covid climate.I was confirmed that there was a bar downstairs  to find out after being stared at, that it would not be opened for another half hour.

"131";"Cirque Stratosphere - great venue, awful show";"We only had 2 nights in Melbourne, so we had to make the very best of them. The first night was already taken up with a tour, so we had to source some entertainment for the 2nd night. So we decided on a show. Which show we weren't too sure. We wanted a combination off seeing a great venue as well as a good show.<br><br>Our cruise ship concierge (originally from Melbourne) suggested Hamer Hall. Apparently it has some of the best accoustics around. So we checked out what was showing. Turns out there was a show, similar to that of cirque de Soleil, or near to that effect anyway.<br><br>Turns out it was far from it. The circus acts themselves were fine, but the acts in between were just plain awful. Actors were dragging people on stages against their will using the audience to convince them to get on stage. Once on stage, the humiliation began,including that of my husband, having a bin bag put over his head and rude/crude jokes following on from there. This was the case for many of the audience. Someone else was forced to eat a vegimite sandwich and another to 'scull' a drink.....all while the audience are yelling 'scull scull scull' being led in vocal chanting by the main actor. Very strange behaviour considering half the audience were children (it was school holidays).<br><br>Such a shame, as the building itself is superb, seating great, lobby amazing, staff friendly, toilets clean etc etc<br><br>They need to vet shows coming into this place. This show was wrong on many levels, was very poor and seemed the polar opposite of the kind of show one would expect to see at a venue of this stature.";
"131";"Magnificent building";"Hamer Hall is a magnificent building. It is the main venue for performances of  jazz, rock, pop, multicultural, chamber, classical, cabaret and contemporary music. The walls of the building are painted in colours and patterns that reflect Australia's gemstone deposits, giving the impression the building was carved out of a hillside.";
"131";"Annual performance at the hall";"A good venue to see a show, no pillars to get in the way of your view. The best place to sit when seeing a show, in my opinion, is not too close to the front of stage, to get the full effect of the staging etc - anywhere from row K is best. Parking - I like to park in the ballet centre which is behind the arts centre, easy to enter and exit, there is a connecting walk over to the arts centre precinct making it ideal.";

This would have to be the best tribute show we have been to ' we enjoyed every minute of the 2 hour concert. Dean Bourne as Roy Orbison (with his backing group) was absolutely brilliant.

We sat in the stalls on the ground level, just a few rows away from the stage, which was great because we could see the conductor, orchestra, and singers really clearly. The sound quality was good and ambience was beautiful. Legroom was sufficient for me to cross my legs and place my bag.

The name is derived from the Wurrundjeri people, who lived here before white settlement. Birrarung means river of mists and Marr means the side of the river.

BUT you have to pay for food via normal EFTPOS (not poss as a pommie visiting Melb). or credit card (again not ideal due to credit card surcharges abroad)- basically they don't take cash. So if like me - it seems your remaining option means you have to use an EFTPOS 'gift' card. Available in various denominations- but only $25 or $50 available when I went. I worked on the premise that although great food- it's not likely to be cheap (being a food market tourist thing)- so went for the sensible option of the $50 card. (Note it cost $55- because $5 for the plastic card itself?!?!) <br><br>Picked and tried lots of good food- esp some chicken kebab things. Ended up being greedy and running low on the card funds and wanted to pick at more food- am only here once you know!!! '' <br><br>So I asked where I can top up the gift card. Transpires ... you can't top it up, they have no facilities on site to check your card balance (thank goodness I kept the running total in my head) .... so this free entry market cost me $5 extra for a card I was kind of made to choose, can't top it up, can't check balance easily?!?? Not quite so free after all... ' I could always buy another gift card (incl the extra $5)...or pay my UK credit card/ debit card charges instead. Great food. Not so great logistics to actually buy the fab food. Slightly disappointed. '";

Its 20 acres, which opened in 2002, feature three terraces and open grassy spaces between the Central Business District and the Yarra River. <br><br>A sound sculpture -- the Federation Bells -- attracted our attention on the middle terrace. Thirty-nine inverted bells of various sizes are mounted on poles in a large space. Computer controlled, they play compositions thrice daily, in morning, at noon and in late afternoon. We missed a concert but enjoyed walking among the bells for a closer look.<br><br>The upper terrace, which is street side, held no interest. It featured much grass, simply waiting to be the venue for the next scheduled large exhibition or event. Instead, we focused on the lower terrace, which hosts native vegetation along with big Elm trees. This is where the Yarra River Trail runs along a gravel track on the water's South side. Shaded benches invite passersby to sit for a while and watch the river traffic -- canoes and kayaks when we were there. <br><br>Our favorite sculpture in the park -- Angel by Deborah Halpern -- stands on the lowest terrace. The almost 33-foot-high whimsical creation displays two heads with a ceramic-clad body depicting 16 colorful images that represent different life forms, such as a crocodile, plants and fantasy creatures. <br><br>This quiet park holds much more, including a big children's playground, and we found the space much fun to explore.

So be careful as crowd can fill up platform and gets close to edge.  23.2.23 takes about 12 mins to walk from here to Rod Laver.

Princes Park is also the home Carlton Football Club, which hasn't been very well in recent years, despite being traditionally one of the Australian Football League's strongest teams.";

I am so glad we chose to do this! The tour costs $20 dollars for an adult ticket, which may sound steep but was in my opinion very worth it. The cost of the tour also goes directly back in to the education centre at the Shrine for school children.<br><br>Michael gave a thorough and very detailed tour, covering how the Shrine came to be, it's very specific and well thought out design/location and the Shrine's significance. Michael talked a lot about Australia's involvement in the First World War, which was a lot more than I realised (I am not from Australia) and was very interesting. So much of the information covered is things we would not have known about had we not done the tour, as I don't believe the information is displayed/explained in such detail around the site.<br><br>The tour lasts for 45 minutes, but there is a lot the tour does not cover as there simply is not the time. If you decide to do the tour, I would recommend going earlier than your time slot as there is a museum element you don't get to see otherwise. The tour also does not go up to the balcony so you would need to allocate time to do this separately. <br><br>I cannot recommend this tour enough.";

Reminded me of Buckingham Palace (BP) that I visited in Oct last year.  Before you smirk - let me clarify..not so much in grandiosity and old masters artwork (artwork is pretty good here too esp. the ceiling to floor portrait of operetta Dame Nellie Melba) but very similar in layout. This Italianate mansion still mantains the grandeur beyond the era it was built with the bounty of the gold rush of 1850s. The Ballroom will definitinely give BP a run for its money!

The gardens and paths are well maintained and clearly sign posted. Most are accessible for wheelchairs or prams, but there are some areas that have steps.

We were then informed that there was only one PandO bus at 1pm and no others till 3.30pm. As we had no chance of getting on board the bus, we decided, as many others did, to try for a taxi or Uber. The road to our pickup area was flooded and cars could not enter, so we were forced to leave the racecourse in the driving rain and walk to an agreed pickup point.

The Showgrounds are located in the inner north-western suburb of Ascot Vale. Parking is usually tight, it's worth taking the train or tram. By the way, Victoria may look small on the map, but it's actually about the same size as the United Kingdom.";
"175";"All the fun of the fair";"Melbourne Showgrounds host o number of fairs and exbibitions during the year, but the biggest and best loved is the Royal Melbourne Show. The Show brings the country to the city, it's based around agriculture. Apart from handicrafts and cooking, the carnival sideshows draw a big crowd. The Show draws visitors from all over Victoria, it's  an opportunjty for country folk to get together and swap stories.";
"175";"A Wonder";"This is a great place to go when there are events on, it can often get busy but it's a pretty huge venue, easily accessible by public transport (57 and A Special Events Train). One of the biggest carnival happens here, The Royal Melbourne Show. If your in Melbourne while there is an event you should really go.";

Of course Hamilton is amazing, we can all agree on that, but the theatre was also pretty fantastic. Check-in was seamless, the staff were all wonderful, and the seats (for a historic theatre) were not bad at all. I would most definitely recommend this theatre to anyone looking to catch a world-class production.";
"177";"Great Show, but better before the changes";"We enjoyed the show.  But were disappointed that the content had been changed, to it's detriment.  This is the sixth time we have seen it in London and once in New York over several decades.  I felt the scene with many people trying to sing the Phantoms composition was unnecessary.  And what happened to the.powerful scene where many are climbing down and singing and where the Phantom sings above the stage.<br>Disappointed.<br>ALL the cast were absolutely excellent, as was the orchestra.";
"177";"Marvelous Melbourne";"Her Majesty's Theatre is said to be Australia's finest lyric theatre. The theatre is luxuriously appainted in gold and crimson, with velvet seating. The theatre dates from 1886, when Melbourne was truly  Marvelous. The interior was redone in the 1930s in Art Deco style. This classical theatre is reopening after the covid lockdown with the Disney musical, Frozen. Melbourne's East End Theatrical District is rivaled by only London and New York.";
"177";"Patron on their phone, usher did nothing to help.";"Saw Hamilton on a week night. After the doors closed, the show began. 2 patrons arrived late and sat next to my guest and I. They missed the setup and house rules instruction. One of them continuously used their phone (typing away, bright screen light, made very little attempt to cover the behaviour). His behaviour continued throughout the whole of first half before the intermission.<br>Not one single staff or usher stepped in. It made the experience really unpleasant. The musical was great but heavily impacted by poor staff and poor etiquette from some patrons.";

Lousy view with a pillar right in front.<br><br>Show is fantastic! Cast is fantastic! Music is excellent! <br><br>Never watch any original movie by Julie Andrews, but I simply enjoy the show by this cast!";
"177";"Stalwart of Melbourne's theatre district";"One of Melbourne's favorite live theatres, Her Majesty's has been remodeled over the years to keep up-to-date with current trends. With the long run of the Broadway hit musical Hamilton coming to an end, the next major show will be a revival of the Disney family favorite, Mary Poppins. Her Majesty's has a long history as a stalwart of Melbourne's theatre district.";
"177";"Very Nice Theatre!";"Went to see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. This was our 1st visit to Australia so we wanted to do something we do in the states, and compare. The seats were very comfortable and I could not see any obstructed views. The ticket price and the snack prices were very reasonable. This theatre is centrally located and very easy to walk to. I would recommend this to any show lovers!";
"177";"Poor view but great show";"We saw 'Mary Poppins', having seats in one of the stalls' back rooms that are obstructed by the balcony above.<br><br>The show itself was excellent but we couldn't see Mary descending from the heights, and nor could we fully observe a couple of scenes where Bert sings on top of the row of houses.<br><br>However the dancing was excellent and the scene changes well executed, seamlessly.  Actors and actresses were good.<br><br>Her Majesty's also has comfortable seating and a good atmosphere, including the orchestra pit.";

Sat in row O of the stalls and view was great. Booster seats available for kids to use. Close to Parliament station and Chinatown. <br>Shrek was great with interesting sets and costumes. Ben Mingay and Todd McKenney did a wonderful job. Only disappointment was the lack of Shrek themed stuff in lobby/ upstairs.... when we saw Charlie and the Chocolate factory here there were some cool things for the kids to do.... would have liked a few photo opportunities for the kids and to promote on social media!";

"178";"Jagged Little Pill";"Beyond Brilliant every aspect of this show was fantastic right down to the dancer the Leads and the songs. Your orchestra was brilliant, staging was a minimal and suited the storyline perfectly. We went to this show blind meaning we had no idea what it was about it was a blind buy. We didn't look up anything about it just took a risk and was BLOWN away. You MUST go see this show it's BEYOND Brilliant! Thank you to the cast for giving us an exceptional experience.";
"178";"Jagged Little Pill";"Musical of a different kind. <br>None of the flashy showy costumes like Moulin  Rouge. No fancy dress up of the stage pre show either. But'.<br>Story line is good, Dancing fantastic, and multiple very talented singers/actors taking on Alana's solo's and serving then up with gusto!!! Nat is brilliant surrounded by the other amazing principle leads.<br>Do yourself a favour and experience a musical of a completely different sort. <br>My only thing to pick on would be the uncomfortable seats. Comedy Theatre need to put some better padding between those inner springs and the outer leather layer.";
"178";"Return to a gentler era";"The Comedy Theatre is a reminder of times when people got dressed for a show, because there was nothing much else to do besides the pictures. The Comedy, with its intricate interior decorations and proscenium stage, has hosted many performances but probably none like Come from Away, set in the Newfoundland town of Gander. Other Canadians regard the Newfie mode of expression as quaint but they won the hearts of the travelers they rescued. It's a good show and few in the audience leave the theatre without a tear in their eye.";
"178";"Disappointing";"I appreciate the cast are talented, but the story, or how it was delivered just isn't strong enough to be turned in a show. Obviously some enjoyed it much more than us, with a few standing and clapping like they had just seen Warlow in Phantom of The Opera, but seriously it was just a show. Also charging over $300 for 2 tickets to see that show is bordering on extreme. Was good to be able to see any show during Covid, but l think this show only attracts audiences because there's nothing much else on. Was less than enthused and pretty disappointed overall. We also intentional went with no idea of the story of the show, so had no preconceived expectations. Disappointing.";
"178";"Florentine on the outside, Spanish on the inside";"The Comedy Theatre is  owned by the Marriner Group, one of several theatrical properties managed by David Marrriner. It's quite striking  -- Florentine on the outside, and Spanish on the inside. It dates from 1928, when the world was on the cusp on the Great Depresssion. The Comedy is a nice size for a musical theatre. The last show I saw there was Come from Away, a touching musical about a Canadian town that saved a group of plane passengers from destitution.";
"178";"Comfortable, good viewing and easy to access";"I saw a matinee of Come From Away here yesterday.  Amid a packed crowd of elderly theatregoers, it was still easy to get into the venue and find my seat.  I had a wonderful view of the stage and my seat was actually comfortable with sufficient leg room - not always a guarantee in theatres!  Theatre is not massive but it is quite cosy and appropriate for this show.  Decor is lovely after a refurbishment.  Access with prepurchased electronic tickets was easy and straightforward.  Thoroughly enjoyed my day.";
"178";"Theatre Magic!";"What a wonderful theatre experience.  We went as a family of 6 to see 'A Christmas Carol'  on Christmas Eve and what a treat it was!  The show was magical and the actual theatre itself was a treasure! Enjoyed every moment of this day out.  A fairly small theatre compared to many but that means you get a better view!  Ten out of ten.";
"178";"Melbourne live theatre is to be seen and believed";"At the Comedy the come from away stage show was just a great musical with a story written around a true event. This is another example of the no end of the depth of talent of Australian actors and musicians. The Sunday matinee was perfect for those not liking late nights and it suited to this magnificent theatre. Well done cast and crew we really enjoyed your show. Highly recommended to visit before this show finishes its' season";
"178";"Come From Away";"Decided to see this show as we had time. The show was great, a cast of only 12 actors and fantastically managed (and supported by the band).<br>The theatre is one of the few I have been in that had staggered row seating, ie I was not sitting directly behind someone. That made such a difference to the viewing of the show.<br>It is a smaller theatre, and more intimate because of that.<br>Would recommend both the show and the venue.";
"178";"Comedy Theatre";"This theatre was built in 1928 so not as old as Her Majesty  theatre but is on a site  with a long theatrical history. It was specifically built for staging plays.

"179";"Take a gamble";"I've been to about thirty la mama shows over 5 years or so, it's a gamble but even the worst show there is never unwatchable. Always unpredictable, and always at least an anecdote. Lots of experimental stuff but some real gems that I'm so glad I've seen. The experience is also very cute, with lovely quirky front of house staff, tea and coffee, a raffle at the beginning and a beautiful renovated courthouse. Definitely go to la mama if you can! '";

For over 40 years this place has been a space for theatre-makers to explore brave new theatre. It takes a hell of a lot of hard work, courage and imagination to keep an independent theatre space open for so many years.<br><br>Every show I have seen here has been original and innovative. Hit or miss I have loved my experience every time I visit. It is tragic to hear of the recent fire that tore through the main La Mama theatre space :( But even in adversity La Mama have continued to put on shows.<br><br>If you are visiting from interstate or overseas and want to see more than just the Melbourne Star or take snaps of graffiti - check out a show here immediately!";

Captain Cooks' cottage was dismantled and shipped in 253 packing crates in 1934 from Yorkshire, England to Melbourne.  We visited in December and the flowers in the conservatory were, in a word, stunning.  The vibrant colors and bloom varieties gave no indication it was winter.  The carvings on the Fairies Trees are of Australian animals and birds.  Gifted by the residents of Lambeth England, the 28 model buildings represent a typical Tudor village.  If you visit, I am sure you will agree it's a great place to walk, jog, relax, enjoy a picnic, or simply enjoy nature.";

We had only limited time to tour the gardens but what we saw and experienced was delightful, We were impressed and, if possible, will spend more time there on a future visit to Melbourne. We particularly liked the general atmosphere of spacious lawns, large trees and planted gardens - all in close proximity to a large city. We strolled briskly through the gardens, taking in as much as we could in the limited time we had and were glad to see Cook's cottage and the interesting gift to the Melbourne people of a miniature Tudor village. Unfortunately, we had no time to sample the refeshments available at the visitors' centre nor to adequately view the souvenirs available for purchase, but we would definitely like to return to the Fitzroy Gardens for a more leisurely visit some time in the future.

Captain Cook's cottage is also here (it was actually his parent's house) and a cafe as well as a Conservatory that houses some interesting plants.There is an aboriginal scar tree that is a sobering reminder us what has been lost since white settlement.

One surprise was walking into the massive former customs hall which was so cavernous. The temporary exhibition on the second floor I saw on my visit included personal accounts from immigrants and residents of Melbourne, as well as a section on advertising and groceries and similar items that weren't considered offensive in the past but are very offensive to immigrants today.

There can be few Australian families without a connection to these New Australians. By the way, the Museum has a charming Tribute Garden that can be accessed from Flinders Lane.";
"187";"Now more of a cultural museum";"Years ago I funded a Family Plate for the wall in the tribute garden and went to see the museum at my earliest opportunity. I enjoyed seeing all the early photos of ports, ships and families arriving and the mock ups of early travel goods, furniture and early home life / hostels and cottages. <br><br>Now, I only saw a couple of suitcases as I entered then the rest of the museum was more about Aussie culture than immigration, including some woke rubbish about drag queens of all things. <br><br>Pretty much a disappointment as I had built it up to my two kids and most of what  I had remembered was gone. <br><br>A few displays were okay but overall, not worth it. <br><br>The tribute garden is nice and no entry ticket is required to see just that.";
"187";"Good but expensive";"Having visited all the free museums and galleries in Melbourne over the days prior, we were disappointed to have to stump up 15 bucks for this place. Only took us an hour and we were out. I would have rated it 4 stars if it was priced 10 bucks or lower.";
"187";"We all came from somewhere else";"In 1914, when the ANZAC spirit  was being forged at Gallipoli, Australia's  population had not even reached 5 million. Now Australia's population is 25 million. The people who  made up the difference came frrom somewhere else. This museum opened in 1998. It is housed in the old Customs Building in Flincers Street. . Its main display area is the Long Room. This space is constructed according to  a Renaissance Revival design. . The Museum has audio-visul and static displays., as well as visiting exhibitions. It's well worth spending an hour or two here.";
"187";"Tells a story that needs to be told with caveat";"With all the world's discussion about immigration going on right now, this museum is telling an important story. The museum is not huge, but it takes a while to read the stories. The story is nicely laid out with a mixture of macro-facts and individual stories. A foreigner like me wouldn't know about the British favored immigration policies or the white Australia movement without someone to tell the story. The special exhibit in the upstairs about discovering your identity was okay, but a little sophomoric in my opinion. But, I've been exposed to this sort of thing for thirty years. perhaps my college age nephews would have found it enlightening. I think the museum needs to look a little more closely at the interaction between the pre-existing cultures and the immigrant cultures to improve its display.";
"187";"Fascinating Insight";"Housed in the beautiful Customs House, make sure you look at the impressive Long Room on your visit.<br> The Museum offers a fascinating insight to many aspects relating to the subject of immigration. Individual stories of people who travelled to Victoria. To the changing face of peoples perceived ideas of immigrants. You can also play the entry game with immigration questions and check out if you would pass or not.<br>Make sure you book your tickets before hand as visitor numbers are limited.";
"187";"An experience";"The Immigration Museum is not one of the most interesting museums but it does provide some relevant information about the history of Australia's immigration. There are quite a few different stories that are told. Not a must see, but only if you really want to visit.";

There is also a church shop inside on the way out. Donations can be made electronically as well. <br><br>Definitely worth the quick visit (15-30min) to admire the architecture and escape the hub-bub outside.";

Construction of this Gothic masterpiece began in 1880 and it opened in 1891.  The spires (315 ft high) were added in 1926-32. Exterior is dark sandstone and the interior is sandstone, limestone and bluestone. Very beautiful inside and out. I visited in late afternoon and was able to come back at 5:10pm to attend the Choral Evensong and hear the magnificent pipe organ (built in England in 1890).";
"188";"Lovely architecture";"St. Paul's Cathedral is located opposite the iconic Flinders Street Station and it is really beautiful. <br><br>It is free to enter and look around, but you are not allowed to take photos of the inside unless you have a license which is available inside the cathedral. <br><br>We only spent around 20 minutes looking inside the cathedral which I think is enough time to take in the beauty and unique features.

Amazing mosaic floor tiles too!";
"188";"Iconic cathedral is a Gothic masterpiece";"In the late 19th century, Melbourne was Marvellous, and the citizens wanted a cathedral that matched Melbourne's opulence. The Anglican Diocese commissioned William Butterfield, the most famous architect of his age, to design a Gothic cathedral to match the world's best. Construction began in 1880. St Paul's is considered to be Butterfield's final masterpiece. St Paul's is an iconic building. it's open to everyone.";

The Forum, which was completed in 1929, can accommodate several thousand fans for live music, theatre, cinema, drama and events. A big line-up of live music is planned for 2021. The Forum is at the corner of Flinders St and Russell. Have a look, if only to take in the atmosphere.";
"189";"The Forum Theatre";"I wrote a review about this in 2014 and it is well worth visiting again. It was formerly the State Theatre and built in 1929. At the time it was the largest in Australia with 3371 seats. It is unique as has a blue ceiling,twinkling stars and projected clouds. The interior incorporates elements of the Italian medieval,Renaissance, Baroque and Spanish Mission styles.. In 1962 it split into the Rapallo and Forum Theatre.For many years it was the Christian Revival Crusade building before going back to a theatre.<br>Hopefully soon after the corona restrictions are eased it will re open. It is on the Victorian Heritage Register and is National Trust classified.";
"189";"Largest theatre in Australia";"The Forum was originally the State Theatre. it opened in 1929, the year the Great Depression  hit. The theatre looks like it's straight out of the Roaring Twenties. It was originally a picture theatre, and is still used for the Melbourne Film Festival. Mostly its used for live performances, most of which appeal to a hipster demographic. The Forum can contain around 2,000 concert goes, making it the biggest theatre in Australia. The Forum is certainly gaudy, but most hipsters like it that way.";
"189";"Live music";"The Forum offers a fantastic live music venue right in the heart of the city. The decor is amazing (even the ladies room was elegant) and there is a great floor area for concerts as well as two levels of elevated seated area and more elevated standing room behind so you're assured a good view of the stage from all areas. Acoustics are great for live concerts. Much nicer place to see your favourite music than newer venues that offer no charm or personality!";

"189";"AMAZING!!!";"Such a divine building absolutely stunning.<br>Saw Conrad Sewell perform on Friday night and WOW! Just WOW!<br>Not too crowded, easy acsess to toilets, bar, exits ect and no matter where you are standing a great view of the stage. Such an intimate and beautiful setting! A definite must if you get a chance";
"189";"Atmospheric";"One of only a handful of atmospheric theatres in the world, featuring a cerulean ceiling curving down behind a cast frieze of ancient Greek buildings, the Forum feels like an outdoor auditorium. The magnificent tiled floors and separate ladies' and gentlemen's lounges hark back to a bygone era of theatre design.<br>Because the theatre is used for a variety of event types, show seating is on individual chairs, save for two rows of u-shaped booths about two-thirds of the way back from the stage.<br>Because we booked tickets on-line we were given the option to pre-book parking at the adjacent Flinders Gate Carpark at a heavily discounted rate.";
"189";"Gotta love the Forum!";"Such a beautiful venue! All the smart touring acts (or at least those with smart booking agents) choose to play at the Forum (or the Palais in StKilda). Sonic Youth and CatPower are Forum highlights from years gone by. Love x 100000 for the Forum.";

Anyway, beautiful venue.....staff need to put their manners back in!!";

"189";"Good venue to see Urzila Carlson";"Went to see Urzila Carslon comedian at the Forum.  It is a lovely old place keeping it in its original style giving it character.  The seating are on plastic seats that can be removed on the wooden floor.  The show was opened up to more seating beyond the drop down seating floor area.  We were close to the stage off to the side.  Had no trouble seeing the performer.  Urzila was very funny, had me in stitches and laughing all the way through the one hour show.  I have seen numerous comedians over the years through the Melbourne Comedy festival.  She is one of the few who can keep going throughout the whole hour having you laughing the whole time without any flat spots.  I notice the black spot time when the routines go flat is around the 40 minutes.  When it finished you felt you wanted to stay and see more.  Great comedian - will love to see her again.";

Interstate trains leave from Spencer Street Station or as it is now known as Southern Cross Railway Station. A Myki card is needed to go on trains and most public transport and can be purchased at newsagencies, some convenience stores, online and train stations. <br><br>Flinders Street Station situated in the vicinity of many famous attractions is bound to be a stepping stone to many an adventure in Melbourne.

"191";"Wonderful market, wish it was my local";"First visit to this small bustling vibrant market. Really impressed with the range and quality of fresh foodstuffs on offer especially the meat and seafood. Lots of people were enjoying the succulent looking oysters at various counters. Delis had everything one would expect and more. The specialist spice shop quickly directed me to Aleppo pepper which I'd tried to find unsuccessfully in various other shops. <br>Had a look at the various stalls and restaurants offering a variety of cuisines to enjoy onsite or takeaway. <br>After all the wandering had an excellent coffee and Italian sweet pastry at the outdoor tables. <br>Left the markets with cheese and bread for lunch, meat and vegetables for dinner. <br>Prices were good for the quality and freshness. <br>Will need to investigate homewares etc on next visit";
"191";"I like it here!";"We came here via tram 96. <br><br>We first ate the goat curry with rice and pho with duck drumstick @ BABA Vietnamese stall at the corner of the food section.

"191";"Take The Tram";"This indoor market is right on the tram route to St. Kilda so easy to get to. Take care to be sure the market is open as it isn't open every day. Fresh produce, meats, and seafood abound and the shucked oysters are plentiful. A good place to shop for unique items, get a haircut, a bouquet of flowers, a pedicure and much more. People watching is great. We found going later in the day the vendors reduced prices especially if the market is closed the next day.";
"191";"Better than Queen Victoria Market";"This is smaller than Queen Victoria Market but seems more popular and packed. Similar concept of a mix of crafts, retail, fresh seafood, fruits and veg and dried goods. But more towards the artsy bit, even the desserts are more artisan-ish.<br><br>We ended up eating most of our time here - lobster potato salad, fresh tiger prawns that even the kids love, some sushi (not too great) and Arancini (disappointing).";

If you love a market can spend 2 hours here, wandering and stopping for food. Can get good quality clothes, kitchenware, authentic Birkenstocks. Fresh vegie prices not as cheap as Vic market but quality good. If you are a tourist I recommend catching the no. 96 tram from the CBD. Parking can be an issue on a market day but not impossible. If you love seafood head down the back to where you can get oysters to slurp, all manner of seafood treats, even fresh sea urchin prepared for lunch - pretty special.";
"191";"Bustling, Busy and Brilliant";"Toss up between Prahran and South Melbourne markets on our short visit to Melbourne and opted for the latter. <br>Got out to the markets thanks to Mr Uber and found the place was in full swing and easily the busiest single place we visited on our trip. <br>It was great to wonder around and absolutely loved the food section of the market and was very jealous and envious of the locals having this at their fingertips.<br>There was plenty of other interesting stalls with lots of variety in crafts and wares. <br>Also got to have a sit down and a cuppa along with some fresh Sydney Rock oysters from NSW South Coast - terrific value and excellent (I'm told). <br>Highly recommend if you have the opportunity and a couple of hours to spare.";

The doctor was excellent - he listened carefully to my concerns and provided a thorough examination. I felt confident in his ability to properly diagnose and treat me.

I did not feel like a number but felt that they each cared what happened to me as an individual. I appreciate what pressures these people are under every day with the numbers of people going there to seek medical help.  We are very fortunate to have this type of facility to go to and to have front line workers who give their time day in and day out to help us when we need help. They should be given the respect they deserve. My hat is off to all of them.";

The staff were simply amazing on every level, always conducting themselves in the most professional way, yet always displaying compassion and caring. Although they were busy, none of my requests ever took long to be fulfilled, and one nurse went well above and beyond to locate something for me after my transfer from ICU. I really can't speak highly enough of them and will always be grateful to them. The food was a little standard, however, this is a public (not private) hospital with many mouths to feed, and overall there was a good selection.  My thanks to you all at RMH, you are amazing.";

We were seen very quickly despite the busy waiting room, and the staff did everything to make my friend comfortable.

The early parts of the University were built of sandstone, by hand, by stonemasons, In 1856, stonemasons working on the Melbourne University  site downed tools and marched into the city, gathering other workers on the way. At the Parliament of Victoria, they demanded an 8-hour day -- 8 hours work, 8 hours rest and 8 hours recreation. Their stoppage led to improved working conditions across the nation, and then across the world. The Great Australian Gold Rush led to a demand for labor, and the 1850s were a period great progress for working men. The Labour Day holiday commemorates this walkout.";
"197";"World ranked research university";"The University of  Melbourne was founded  in 1853, at the height of the Great Australian Gold Rush. From these humble beginnings, the University has become one the world's highest-rated research institutions. Courses of study range  from science to languages and the arts. It's favoured by foreign students, who fit into  Melbourne's diverse culture.";
"197";"Its Residential Colleges Can Host Guests Too";"If you are a visitor to the University of Melbourne and if you are looking for a place to stay during your visit, a great choice can be one of the university's 10 residential colleges. Many of these have some apartments for hosting guests. You do pay a fee but it's a reasonable, especially if you plan to stay longer than a couple of days. I've stayed at Trinity College and University College twice each, with the most recent visit last week. The location is on campus, not far from many of the academic departments. You get to use most of a college's facilities, including its dining hall. During term time, you also get to meet with students over meals, and you may be invited to dine at the High Table for dinner.";
"197";"This university is serious about scholarship";"Sir Redmond Barry was an Anglo-Irish jurist who featured prominently in colonial Victoria's public life.. He was, amongst other things, first Chancellor of the University of Melbourne. It is notable that the University of Melbourne, while accepting large numbers of foreign students, has maintained high academic standards and adhered to the notion of academe. Described as a sandstone university, Melbourne has many buidlngs of historic worth. It is the second oldest univesrsity in Australia and the oldest in Victoria. The University of Melbourne has several campuses, but the main campus is in Parkville, just to the north of Melbourne's CBD..";
"197";"Henry Forman Atkinson Dentral Museum well worth a visit";"I couldn't find a separate listing for this museum so have logged this review under the University's page. The Museum is small but excellent. Like several of the museums at the university, it takes a bit of finding but had some fascinating collection items - even Etruscan bridgework! Loved the recreated dental surgery from about 1900.";

The University of Melbourne is one of the few. There are many architectural styles in use and entry is unrestricted. There are a number of dining facilities available. Some of the buildings and colleges date back about 130-150 years. I especially like the Law Quadrangle, the Old Arts, and the Old Pathology buildings.";

This tour opened our eyes to the wealth of Indigenous history where we live and work. I was blown away by how little I actually knew about the local area, but also Indigenous history. Our tour guide, Lucas, was very personable, very passionate and highly knowledgable. I highly recommend this tour for any visitors to this great city, but also locals who want to know a bit more about the local area and its Indigenous history.";
"198";"A true (and excellent)  look at Aboriginal Culture";"We wanted to learn more about the lifestyle and culture of the early Aboriginals. Unfortunately most places only give a look at modern art produced by Aboriginals. Koorie gave us a look at clothing, tools and stories of the past. This is a true treasure trove of knowledge and most appreciated. We highly recommend this place and tour for those truly seeking a look at Aboriginals.";

There were several locations along the Birrarung river where I learnt things I hadn't known before about Melbourne. Back at the Yarra building I was able to engage with realistic representations of Koorie culture in the form of weapons, clothing and language. Overall a very insightful and educational experience.";
"198";"A Hidden Gem";"This is a fascinating place to visit. If you have time watch the short 11 videos about Aboriginal artists on the top floor and the go and watch their beautiful pieces of jewellery. The temporary art exhibition was definitely worth a visit to. This little gem is so easy to miss in Federation Square. But a little gem";

The Koorie HeritageTrust  displays many artifacts connected with  the Koorie people.  They are quite enthralling. There is also a display of art by Aboriginal painters. If you are looking for authentic Aboriginal souvenirs, the gift shop has an extensive range of Koorie  arts and crafts. Entry is free.";
"198";"Not to be missed.";"This gallery/centre/education facility is in a prominent building on Federation Square but it is too easy to bypass it even though there are notices outside. It is a mix of gallery and museum and education centre. The temporary art exhibition of works by aboriginal artists in the local community was fascinating for the talent on show and the variety of work that is by no means all 'dot' paintings although there were some fine examples of that genre. On upper floors there was a small exhibition of works by kids and a collection of artefacts with good explanations. It is small, does not take up much of your time and it is well worth wee detour across the square.";
"198";"An interesting place to visit";"Federation square has many attractions, but we inadvertently wandered into Koorie Heritage Trust. We were glad we did. Just from the art displayed at the entrance of the door, I already know this would be an interesting place to visit. They have the largest collections of Koorie arts and artefacts on display, promoting the living culture of the Indigenous people of south-east Australia. That was an educational visit. Happy Travelling!";
"198";"Quality Museum and Gallery";"I learned much from the exhibits and artifacts about aboriginal history in this area.  I was especially impressed with the art exhibition - full of colour and interesting design.  My only regret was that Christmas is so far off as I would buy my presents here. Entry is free as well.";
"198";"Don't miss this hidden gem!";"Wow! What a lucky find! I went thinking I would see some indigenous art and found so much more...the temporary exhibits were all wonderful and interesting and I also stumbled upon, and joined, a tour/lecture taking place.  Next time I will try to schedule one, the guide was so informative and engaging.  Very nice small gift shop as well.  Don't miss this.";
"198";"A bit disappointing";"We were hoping to get a good insight into the indigenous people of Australia. This didn't really hit the mark. The lower and upper level has lots of original artwork and artifacts from Aboriginal culture, but we were looking to hear the Aboriginal story. Also, disappointing that we didn't see any Aboriginal employees who could have provided some insight.";
"198";"Fantastic introduction to Kulin Nation's history and culture";"My sister and I brought our mum, who is visiting from England from Christmas, on this tour as a Christmas present.

The County Court is a handsome building. Security is thorough, although it is not rushed. The exterior shows the figure of  the Lady of Justice, alongside the Southern Cross. The foyer has a mural, representing the link between law and Aboriginal tradition";
"199";"His Honour Chief Judge Peter Kidd";"In 1957, the County Court was established in the city of Melbourne as a single court for the State of Victoria. The jurisdiction of the County Court was expanded in 1968 to include criminal matters in addition to civil cases. It's a rather exciting and imposing place to be at. <br><br>A new County Court building, designed by SKM and Lyons Architects (Daryl Jackson), was opened on the corner of Lonsdale and William Streets on 31 May, 2002. With 54 courtrooms, the County Court building is Victoria's busiest trial court. This is a beautiful piece of modern architecture.";
"199";"Lady of Justice sculpture";"The role of the County Court is symbolised by the Lady of Justice, a sculpture on the external wall of the Court, which shows a mature female figure, evoking a Grecian relief sculpture. The Southern Cross, which is associated with the Lady ofJustice,  is the symbol of Victoria,, a symbol of fairness and equality, The Lady of Justice sculpture is in William St, it is easy to see.";

The County Court is in the legal precinct, it can be found at 250 William Street. Visitors must undergo a security check, but the staff are not rushed off their feet and they seem to be fairly easy going and are willing to answer questions.";

Many older people still refer to RMIT as The Tech", going back to the days when it was the Working Men's Cellege, and later the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. RMIT is best known for technical disciplines, including fashion, although creative disciples such as creative writing are well regarded.";

It is  now a university, although most most students, past and present, still think of it as' theTech,'the Royal Melbourne Instditue of Technology.  Much of RMIT is old, though Building 8 is colourfully Post  Modern. RMIT tends towards prctical disciples such as engineering, although its creative writiing and design courses are renouned nation-wide. As a former student,  I can say that RMIT never stands sill.";
"200";"Postmedernism That Adds Little To Swanston Street";"It is creative and colorful and diferent and if that was the objective it succeeded but it does not add a whole lot to the image of RMIT or to the top end of Swanston Street  that really did not have a whole lot going for it anyway.";
"200";"Rabbit warren inside";"Much of RMIT dates back well over 100 years and was once a part of the Working Men's College or has been re-purposed from the justice system (old police station lockup or magistrates' court in Russell Street).  This building is much newer. Inside it is a comfy place to sit out of the weather, but the gallery next door is far more interesting.";
"200";"Innovative, strange -- and ugly?";"RMIT University began constructing remarkable post-Modern buildings in the 1990s. These enliven Melbourne's streetscape in the northern part of the city grid and advertise the progressive credentials of RMIT's architecture, building and design courses. I go past Building 8 by tram often, and sometimes I go inside it to use the RMIT library, so I tend to take the building for granted. Yet every now and again I take a fresh look at its façade and think how strange, innovative and perhaps ugly it is. <br>If you find this building interesting, take time to look at the campus's other buildings too.";

They've been supportive through the lockdowns as well and very helpful for me to get back on track. I'm writing this review after all this time because this morning after a night of thunderstorms and a burst water mains led to a water outage in my apartment block, I called the Carlton baths to check if they had water for me to come shower - and they said absolutely! I said I was a member and they said even if you weren't, you're welcome to come and use the facilities. This was a young staff member called Mia. Really excellent values, LGBT friendly, warm and inclusive space. Much recommended! Only wish the pool was open all year around but that's a small issue. I'll be sad when I move away.";

You can easily stand about waiting to use weights in busy times, yet there are many running machines that aren't always used. There are some excellent staff in gymnasium that are always willing to help, but unfortunately there are some that are not so helpful who would rather hide in an office and act busy rather than trying to help and offer advice on techniques when you have requested them to do so. If you live locally it's worth giving it a go to see what you think.";

The changing rooms are clean, the pool is bright and nicely designed (although it takes some getting used to the random 30-metre length) and the receptionists are friendly. I have also never seen it particularly busy. My only slight disappointment was that a single-use locker token is $3.10, which is pretty steep considering that the cost of the swim itself is $7.00. Overall, I still love this place.";
"213";"Great for a swim";"Melbourne city baths have been around for many decades. It is an excellent place to have a swim and the only issue is parking. If you are in Melbourne and want to get rid of some jet lag or just get some exercise then it is worth a visit.";

"214";"No Pink in the Lake";"I visited Westgate park to see the pink lake.  Unfortunately, I was there in January.  The 'pink' lake effect is due to a late summer algae bloom.  In January, the lake is brown and Westgate park is not well maintained.";

It is a regenerated park, but it hosts a variety of habitats for large waterbirds such as swans, spoonbills and pelicans. When it is hot in summer the lake turns a nice shade of pink, a rather unusual phenomenum that is popular with visitors.";
"214";"So Much Potential-But Not Realized";"This large park under the West Gate Bridge was developed in the mid-1980's some years after the completion of the West Gate Bridge and those that developed the concept had a grand  idea but not sustained or fully realized.Once described as scruffy scenery, dead water , swamps, dead  grass and sick factories captured it well as today it can be still described that way. This is a large area with Yarra River access, on the edge of the city but its potential  is neglected. Where else could you get such a large area right at the city edge and on the river to develop a magnificent  park. It could be great and sadly it is not. The views of the rather ugly West Gate Bridge are excellent and there is a vibrant hum of traffic noise.";
"214";"Unique lake turns pink in summer";"The lake in Westgate Park turns pink in late summer, when the weather gets hot. Apparently it is an annual  biological phenomena. It is a blush pink color, it is quite attractive. Westgate Park is a regenerated park, with native vegetation, Westgate Park is one of Melbourne's newest parks. Driving is best, although parking can be limited";
"214";"Turns pink in late summer to autumn";"This rather unique experience is worthwhile and it's free. It's not just a little pink. It's pink pink pink. Free but limited car park but free street parking is also available.";
"214";"Didn't get to view the Pink Lake";"We went to the Westgate Park to view the Pink Lake. A bit of a disappointment as the lake was not pink n colour. So, it is just an ordinary park with two lakes. Apparently, the pinkishness comes during very hot weather when the sun's rays reacts with the algae and salt water. Perhaps another time.";

"214";"Bright pink and great for photos";"It's awesome to see this natural phenomenon when the lake turns pink due to algae and minerals and a lack of rain after the warm weather. Carparking is limited, but if you can't get a spot, exit and go out to the left, then head left at the roundabout and you can park in the nearby industrial area, as there is a walking tracking from the old railway line.";
"214";"A place just for fancy shooting";"The lake is absolutely pink in April and it worth a visit. You can take very nice photos and enjoy it's very unique view. Don't plan for long stay here as it's just the pink lake and nothing more. A must see in Melbourne and it is very close to city center.";

The station is below ground level with escalators and a lift serving each platform. The station is staffed and has a Myki dispensing and topping up machine outside as well. The station was modernised some years back so it has a very modern entry area and a very old section at the far end connecting platforms but not offering an exit. There is a cafe on site for those desperate for an early caffeine hit! A short walk to the Errol St cafes.

The question as to whether James Cook actually lived here is open to conjecture, but it is almost certain that he visited his parents here. This quaint cottage is not a mansion, but most visitors agree that the cottage, with its garden and period furniture, is well worth a visit.";

At first, I thought it might have been a cottage belonging to Captain Cook and where he used to live and was intrigued as to how the city was built up around it, but not so.

When we visited we thought we would see an Australian building where Cook had lived while in this country. We found out reality was slightly different. This cottage was actually built by Cook's parents, in Yorkshire, England, in 1755! The building was brought to Australia after being carefully packed brick by brick and reassembled, in 1934. Still it's interesting and of some historical value. Worth a look if you are in the area.";

It is not a cheap day out $47 per adult and $32 per child plus adding parking of $46 (2hrs parking) We parked in the recommended car park by Sealife but did not get a discount.<br>We pre booked and paid for our tickets online with a time slot but still had to queue to get in which was a little annoying with those who were buying tickets. <br>The highlights were the oceanarium and crock lair.<br>The displays are suitable for all sizes to toddles and babies in prams with low windows and tunnels  as well as teenagers and adults. There are hands in exhibits for the children and interactive screens with information<br>Good access for prams and wheelchair and plenty of places to stop and have a drink or snack, not sure of prices as we did not partake. Toilets very clean<br>Overall an enjoyable morning and would recommend on a hot or wet day";"Compares poorly to other attractions";
"218";"Compared to aquariums elsewhere, this one offers a fairly limited variety of species (the single mature saltwater croc looked especially lonely, but he'd been removed from his croc farm for being a danger to other crocs). Many of the electronic video displays next to the exhibits don't work. There are a lot of activities and attractions aimed at younger children but fewer for adults. Add it all up, and admission prices are a little demanding for what you get.";"Melbourne Aquarium a nightmare";
"218";"The aquarium has turned into a commercilized circus. I was here seven years ago and then experienced an amazing adventure. Today the crowd inside was so big that it was almost impossible to move around and even worse it is was impossible to see anything at all. Screeming kids and prams everywhere made the visit a real nightmare. There was no use to complain due to a poor management that did not listen to our complaints at all. Today 2023 I can not recommend a visit to Melbourne Aquarium. It is hard to understand why this once an amazing attraction now is a ground for business and no enjoyable experience. The aquarium is now a playground for kids.";"Not so great experience this time";

My husband, baby and I were so well looked after. We opted for the double room at an extra $75 per night and it was really worth it to have my husband stay. The food was great (not your standard hospital food!) and we had specialists visit us during our stay as an inclusion, i.e. lactation consultants and physio. I also had support from the staff once we had gone home and I had further questions. Overall a really positive experience!";

The tips and guidance they provided during this time has been so helpful. My waters broke early and I was admitted to the hospital at 33 weeks. The rooms and facilities are so lovely, the food is amazing, it really feels like you're in a boutique hotel. I can't rate this higher.";

First of all, the hospital has poor communication. the hospital was our only option given it is elected by the surgeon. We requested that fees be disclosed upfront given we do not have private insurance for my partner's surgery and overnight stay and everything is out off pocket. this was not done. on the day of the surgery, the hospital asked for $5k payment upfront even though they said payment plan was available (apparently not on the day). Post surgery, no one contacted me and I had to rang around for 4 hours trying to locate where she has been moved to. Finally, we chased the bill for over 2 months after the surgery to see if there are anymore charges with no success, only to be hit with an unexpected invoice in the mail 6 months later asking for more money (on top of the $5k already paid). Avoid this hospital at all cost pros: - nurses were ok cons: - really bad communications (on par with ATO) long hold time, - multiple unexpected invoices sent to you.";
"238";"";"I had an excellent experience here with the maternity team. Had a caesarian, first pregnancy, standard 4 nights stay, early April 2021. I felt like the staff were genuinely there to provide care, not just to do the bare minimum job. We always felt safe, respected, well looked after and any time we needed help they were never far away, which is especially amazing considering how busy they were. Food needs a special mention because it's almost fine dining quality, in fact my husband initially didn't order anything first couple days thinking it would be hospital food, but after tasting them we then paid extra for partner meals for the rest of stay (mine was fully covered as I was the patient), 3 course meal was about $35. If you're an Epworth staff reading this, please thank the chefs!! The standard room was alright, comes with a pull out single sofa for your partner which would be sufficient, but we paid extra $75 per night for double bed, room was a bit more spacious too. The double bed moves together though, so when you're breastfeeding at 4am and need the bed upright, your partner is going to have to follow which isn't so good if he has a back problem for instance. Our room came with kettle, condiments (replenished daily), fridge & microwave,so when they asked if we wanted to move into hotel stay (per their inclusive partnership) we declined - honestly already felt like we were in a hotel, and why do that when all the medical equipment and staff are so readily available here. You may want to consider hotel stay if you have another child though as they allow them to stay over. Parking was not free but you get a discount from standard rates, we weren't far away so we got a friend to drive us in/out instead so we didn't need their parking.

I received an email from my surgeon advising me to contact the hospital to obtain their fees, and when I did this the woman I spoke to (Sarah) was very rude and condescending and told me that I didn't need an estimate from the hospital. I advised her that I had been directly informed by my surgeon to contact them so obviously there was a bit of confusion and that a little bit of kindness would be appreciated, she said 'okay' and hung up on me. Can't say the experience has given me high hopes for my upcoming procedure.";

"239";"Anglican History of Melbourne";"Bishopscourt is the home of the Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne.  Tours are run by contacting the office by e-mail.  You will need to contact me for those details since TA will not allow an e-mail to be posted.  <br>It is both an official residence and a family home.  It is the oldest house in East Melbourne and the first mansion in Melbourne.  It has been the residence of Anglican Bishops and Archbishops in Melbourne since 1853.  The first residents were Bishop Charles Perry and his wife Frances (the ward in the Royal Women's Hospital is named after her).   In 1870, Bishopscourt served as interim Government House for Victoria.  The grant of land (district of Port Phillip) was given by the Governor of New South Wales as at that time Victoria did not exist as a separate State.  The parcel of land granted was from Albert Street all the way down to Wellington Parade (most of which has been sold off) while the Catholics got a small patch of swampland.   They raised their wonderful cathedral on it!<br><br>Frances Perry was noted for her philanthropic work with young, unmarried, pregnant and homeless women and hence the naming of the ward at the hospital in her honour.<br><br>The Fitzroy Gardens opposite Bishopscourt were not developed until 1860.  A wonderful place to relax and enjoy Melbourne's sunshine.<br><br>The architecture of the building reflects the early style and building techniques.  Newson and Blackburn were the architects.  The red brick northern wing was added in 1903.  <br><br>The gardens were laid out by Charles Swyer in 1854.  The garden contains some original plantings including a seedling of the Corroboree Tree (ancient river red gum).  The original tree died in the 1990s.  18 trees are recorded in the Victorian Heritage Register.  It also contains the oldest rose garden in Melbourne.  <br><br>All resident bishops or archbishops made their contribution to both the garden and building.  Look around the garden and see the memorial to Bishop James Moorhouse's pet Tim in 1884.<br><br>The bishops held many garden parties since 1904 and this tradition continues today.  Archbishop Wood's love of figs is shown in the fig trees still seen today in the garden.<br>The lemon tree that can be seen from the morning room had the instruction that the fruit could only be picked from the back so that viewers from the window could enjoy the beautiful fruit on the tree!<br><br>Inside in the Drawing room, the Piano was a gift from a Governor or Victoria as Bishopscourt was temporarily used as Government House while the Victorian Government House was being built.<br><br>In the morning room, each resident left some piece of furniture or painting as their mark on the property.  Much of the furniture was brought from England.  The floorboards and shutters are original.  Note the photograph of Sir Robert Menzies and the toby jug!<br><br>The beautiful Chapel of St John is still in use today for christenings.  It was designed by Walter Bulter in June 1904.  At the time he was a very well known architect in Melbourne who built houses for wealthy Melbournians and rural graziers.  The stained glass windows were shipped from England.<br><br>The dining room has been renovated with Heritage Victoria grants to its original size and style.  It contains the original grant of land.  The oak chairs are original but the rest of the furniture has been purchased for the purpose over time.  <br><br>The current bishop and his wife are keen collectors of Aboriginal art and there are many pieces displayed.

I can't imagine working at 4am is pleasant, however, the nurses on staff were lovely and professional. If you or a loved one is staying here, I have no doubt that you/they will be looked after with the same care and attentiveness I experienced. Thank you to the nurses and staff at SVPH, you made my surgery and recovery much better than I ever expected!";

"241";"Not to be Missed";"After passing the Chinese Museum most days on our way back to our Hotel, on our last day in Melbourne, we visited the Museum.<br><br>It is very informative about the history of Chinese Australians.  We loved to see parts of the Chinese Culture and the Goldrush Exhibit on the lowest level.<br><br>Definitely worth a visit.";

The Museum is in Cohen Place, in the heart of Chinatown. By the way, a statue of Dr Sun Yat-sen, the founder of modern China, can be found neat thde entrance.";
"241";"The history of the Chinese in Australia";"There have been substantial numbers of Chinese people in Australia, at least since the Great Australian Goldrush in the 1850s. This fascinating museum has many artefacts that will interest people of all nations. By the way, look out for the statue of Dr Sun Yat-sen, the founder of modern China, at the front of the building.";
"241";"Site of  Chinese heritage";"Melbourne has a long history of Chinese habitation, which began in the  Great Australian Gold Rush of 1851. There are many artefacts here, it is well worth a visit if you have an interest in Chinese culture.";
"241";"very interesting with the Han exhibition";"I've walked past this place hundreds of times and never ventured in. At $11 for entry, it's very reasonable and easily worth an hour or two. Who knew the mainland Chinese were so integral in Victoria's settling? The basement level has a walk through display that's reminiscent of Sovereign Hill. Pray you don't have school groups going through at the same time. Girl on the front desk spoke next to no English - so just hope you don't have any questions!";
"241";"Great";"Who knew there was a chinese museum in Melbourne, not me, until I was researching what to do.  Its wonderful, very colourful and lots of information about the early days of the gold rush and the role the chinese community played in it. <br>Well worth the visit.";

The new exhibition traces the history of he Han Dynasty. This Museum narrates  the history of the Chinese in Australia, beginning with Mak Sai Ying's arrival in Sydney  from Canton in 1818. The Museum also has the Dragon Gallery, with three significant dragons used in processions. And what would the history of the Chinese in Australia be without the gold miners? The Museum is open 10:00 AM to 4:00 pm every day (public holidays excepted.)";

"241";"Fascinating history of Chinese in Australia";"I visited the Chinese Museum (Museum of Chinese Australian History) in July 2019.  It is located in Chinatown near Lonsdale Street.  It is a fascinating museum.  I bought my ticket from a very nice Chinese lady.  The top floor was dedicated to the history of Chinese immigration in Australia.  It covered the Gold Rush, discrimination, stories of Chinese immigrants.  Other floors had exhibits on the Han Dynasty and artifacts, Chinese paintings, dragons, the gold rush.  About 5 percent of Australia's population is Chinese (over 1.5 million people) and so this museum is very interesting to visit.";
"241";"China town";"A excellent Chinese display and show good history, especially the gold rush days. Has all to explain the culture";
"242";"Bank chambers are listed by National Trust";"The ANZ Bank Museum is being renovated and will reopen in mid 2023. You cannot enter the Museum now, but the Gothic Bank, which adjoins the Museum, is worth a look even if you are not an ANZ Bank customer. The Gothic Bank is from the same era as the Museum. It is listed on the National Trust registry.";
"242";"When banks were glorious";"The ANZ Bank  Museum was constructed when a glorious banking chamber  was evidence of wealth and soundness. In the 19th century, banks did fail, so the bank had to make a favourable impression on their potential customers. This Museum is a wonderful reminder of an age when money was precious.";
"242";"ANZ Bank Museum";"This is the only Bank Museum in Australia now that Westpac Museum in The Rocks has closed. The NAB has archives at Wantirna but closed to the public. The ANZ Bank Museum is down stairs from the street and is next to the ANZ Gothic branch. It opened in 1995 to celebrate 150 years of the beginning of the ANZ. The Museum is well worth a look as has the build up of how the ANZ was formed from mrgers with the Union Bank, ES and A Bank and how it took over banks ike the Bank of Adelaide. It also has displays of money bixes and other interesting items. I even got a big book on the ANZ Bank. It is closed now due to the COVID 19 but when pen is open from 10-00AM to 3-00PM. weekdays. It ios free and well woth a visit.";
"242";"Gothic Bank the inheritor of an ancient tradition";"The ANZ Bank is the result of the merging of several British banks operating in Australia. The Gothic Bank was the  banking chamber of the English, Scottish and Australian Bank (ESA). It opened for business in 1887 and it's still a functioning bank. It's worth taking a look even if you're not an ANZ customer, it's a magnificent sight. The Esanda finance company derived its name from the ES and A Bank. In the old days, a magnificent banking chamber helped convince customers that the bank was sound.";
"242";"A Wonderful Time Machine - Must See!";"As per history this Gothic Bank was the first building to be constructed and is an example of the first Gothic style in the city. It was designed by William Wardell, to fairly detailed specifications laid out by the General Manager, Sir George Verdon.<br><br>The style is restrained externally, and internally graceful and ornate. It is secular Gothic, although Wardell had previously made a name for himself through church architecture.<br><br>Apparently the works began in 1883 and the building was opened in May 1887, a year late. Although it doesn't seem much, but the  final cost was over £77,000, almost twice the budget. today this will be a huge bill with lots of zeros I assume.<br><br>The entire ground floor was established as the banking chamber, and the first and second floors as a residence for the General Manager. Sir George Verdon moved into the residence in 1888 and remained there until his retirement. In 1934 the Lyceum Club leased these rooms and used them until 1957. <br><br>ANZ Banking Museum illustrates the history of Australian banking and financial services. It displays banking equipment, manuscripts and illustrations from the ANZ bank as a substantial archive.<br><br>The exhibition is illustrated by a unique collection of historic moneyboxes and other banking paraphernalia and houses in a magnificent gothic building. I did not see unfortunately a gift shop, but the pictures will do. This is a must and we highly recommend it.";
"242";"ANZ Bank Museum";"Now the Westpac Museum in Sydney is closed tghis is the only one left and is in the old ES and A Gothic Bank. It is a beautiful building and looks more like a church than a bank. It is free and well worth a visit. The National Australia Bank says they have one in Wantirna but I have never checked it out";
"242";"When Banks Had Style Back In 1887";"The E S  and  A Gothic Bank was completed in 1887 and this historic walk-through display includes the old Stock Exchange of Melbourne building in Queens Street around the corner.They show the style and beauty of the buildings back then and worth a look. The ANZ Bank building still operates as a bank and is also worth a look.These two buildings are great examples of what can be seen by walking the streets of Melbourne all thanks to the Gold Rush era..";
"242";"Old school architecture";"This banking chamber in the ANZ Bank on Collins Street is old school architecture that is just not seen in this modern day. Free to wander around it highlights the history of banks and banking in Australia. If you have a free 30 minutes it is worth looking in here.";
"242";"Small area, some nice old archictecure, it is free to stroll through";"Really not a lot to see.  There are some signs with historical information. The best thing to view is the building interior itself which is quite nice old style architecture, very elegant.";
"242";"Follow the history of banking in Australia";"Banks are often thought of as heartless money grubbers, but this museum shows that banking isn't easy trade to follow. The ANZ Bank is to be congratulated for maintaining this fascinating museum. entry is gratis. Banking has come a long way from the colonial era. maintaining the confidence of depositors is the bank's first task. The ANZ is the result of the amalgamation of several English banks operating in Australia. I can still remember when the ANZ's share price was quoted in pounds Sterling.";
