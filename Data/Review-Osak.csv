1;DONT GO. when will we all learn? Do we have to watch animals locked up the saddest thing I’ve ever seen, even if they were treated humanely which they’re not.;Welcome to animal cruelty 101
1;I didn’t really want To visit in the first place but I was with a. Group of friends. Some parts of the aquarium were fine, but once I started seeing giant sea mammals such as dolphins swimming round in tiny areas.Yeah….:nah….:;sorry this is modern day animal cruelty. I suspect these kinds of places will be gone in 50 years time. I wish they were gone now. One of the best aquariums in the world
1;Went there like 40 minutes after opening time and I had to wait like 60 minutes (it was a Monday) to get in. It's actually nice that they do it this way so you get a better experience when you get inside. I wouldn't recommend the backstage viewing. Just buy a regular ticket and enjoy the place. The setting of the whole place is marvellous. I really loved every bit of it! Highly recommended!;To be able to experience the sea
1;If you want to experience various sea creatures when you travel to Osaka, I recommend you to go there at least once. Especially, the order of viewing the aquarium was very attractive. You can see creatures that live at a certain depth in the form of viewing that gradually goes down. But there is also a problem. Some intelligent creatures, such as penguins, dolphins, seals, and whale sharks, are huddling in narrow tanks that do not fit their size. It can be fun for some, but unpleasant for others, for dolphins to do a show at the behest of a trainer in a tank. In fact, many countries have banned the use or confinement of intelligent animals in shows. If the purpose of visiting here is to educate children about sea life, I recommend not to go. They can see the creatures in the aquarium, feel the sea, and see them wonderfully, but it can naturally instill in children the idea that animals are a human's toys, which are animals can be consumed.;Aquarium Inside A Building
1;It will look at first glance like an oddly shaped red and blue building but it is actually the Osaka Kaiyukan which contains within it an aquarium. It is a very popular tourist destination and on the day we visited, we arrived during midday without having booked a ticket only to be told that we had to wait until 4 PM before there is space for us to go into the Kaiyukan. There is thankfully the Tempozan shopping center nearby to kill sometime. Entering the Kaiyukan, the visitor is first directed to the topmost floor and they slowly travel downwards as they explore the contents of the aquarium. Various marine wildlife are on display here but the highlight and the "Stars" of the aquarium is the giant aquarium in the middle of the Kaiyukan containing two giant whale sharks. I daresay that the dark settings add to the atmosphere of looking at these animals in the aquarium. It can get very crowded during the holiday period with lots of kids running around and people bustling through but overall the locals are very orderly. If anything it's the tourists that are disorderly who would not hesitate to elbow people out of the way or use their kids as shields to push in ahead to people. It does take quite a while to go around Kaiyukan and take in the view of the animals. Having gotten in at 4 PM and still having other things to do in the itinerary, we decided to travel around Kaiyukan as quickly as possible and it still took us 2 hours. It would not be surprising at all that it would take people a whole day to complete their visit if they had gone with a more leisurely place. There is a cafe for visitors to grab a rest and some snacks while they are at it with views of Osaka Bay. At the end of Kaiyukan there are two souvenir shops. The first one is the smaller souvenir shop, the second one is the larger one and on the same level at Starbucks. Once the sun has gone down there are light features that you can take pictures next to. I think Kaiyukan is well worth the visit when one is visiting Osaka. It's my second visit to the place and it is still a great place. My first visit made such an impression on me that other aquariums has never been as impressive as the visit here. The only difference with my first visit is that the "Hands on" section where you can touch some of the animals has been removed.;NOT FOR ANIMAL LOVERS
1;WARNING: the aquarium says that is open until 8 pm. However, when I visited at 6:30 pm the lights were set to night time and almost all of the mamals were asleep. The low "moonlight" illumination made it almost impossible to photograph anything.;It's the first time I saw a whale shark in captivity
1;The aquarium had plenty of sea creatures from all over the globe. But I was amazed when I saw a whale shark in an aquarium, and there was more than one.;Enjoyable aquarium visit
1;Its a good aquarium visit but nothing amazing.  Their main attraction is the large tank in the middle with the whale sharks.  My biggest disappointment is the minimal info they provide on the different species they have there.  Wish they did a better job of that so that I could learn a little more about what I was looking at.;A great side visit.
1;It’s a great side visit (not so much of a main itinerary). As I entered I thought the enclosures where kinda small. But as I walked on I realised I was walking down the floors and the tanks where 8 floors deeps. It was a great experience. . Highly recommended if you have extra days. Expect young families with toddlers. But it was not a bother for me. They were well behaved. . I don’t think it’s a must-visit because you can get the same experience in other aquariums around the world. But if you are traveling with kids they would love it. As a solo traveler I spent a good 2 hours there. And finished it off with a meal at the food court. . The surrounding port area was nice too.;Awful, don’t pay for this
1;Do not visit!! Three dolphins in the one area, all three had a collapsed dorsal fin and were chewing on a plastic rope (looks as if they were playing but they continued to do it=stress), the tank even though deep due to the height of the aquarium led to not much swimming room for the dolphins!!  Two whale sharks in one small tank too!! Again both had collapsed dorsal fins!! So sad to see and I regret going!! I never imagined the tanks would be so small!! Please don’t pay for this… they should never be in tanks!!;Not recommended
1;Went here during my birthday weekend in Osaka and the building is great. So many fish to see! The tanks are so big! So many different types of animals to see. Definitely need to see this place. There are times for going through so make sure you aren't too early or late. If so there is a mall next door to walk around.;Beautiful whales shark
1;This is my first time seeing whale shark, it’s so beautiful. good place to spent with children. Reasonable price and animals seems happy and healthy;Family​ Day​ Out
1;Very​ long​ queue​ during​ summer month.​ Many​ activities​ for​ young​ kids.​ You​ could​ easily spend a​ whole​ day​ here.;Horrible
1;Horrible experience. These animals belong in the wild , not explouted in small tanks. Dolphins caught during the brutal Taji drives.;Whale sharks in an round tank
1;nice place good food, great variety of marine life, the cafe had great drinks - I liked the macha milk. I could spend all day on the benches watch the main tank;relaxing and peaceful aquarium.
2;Great Destination;The sight was beautiful. All the waterfronts and the city lights was magnificent. I highly recommend this to people who visit Japan and want to do something fun.
2;Can’t Miss Ferris Wheel;The Tempozan Ferris Wheel is a hard-to-miss place. It towers above the Tempozan Market shopping mall and is just within the vicinity of the Kaiyukan Aquarium. Almost certainly you will pay this ferris wheel a visit just because you are within the vicinity. The lines were not long. The attraction being what it is, people are always steadily getting on and getting of the carriage. For a higher price you can pay to be in the carriage with a transparent floor. They do not allow for strollers to be parked in and around the ferris wheel, the attendants there will either fold it for you or if the stroller is small enough, allow it to be put on the carriage with you while still being open. The ferris wheel ride takes about 15 minutes as you ascend, reach the peak and then begin to descend. We rose the ferris wheel at around 1 PM and the skies were clear so we got a great view of the Osaka skyline and Osaka bay.
2;Nice view;We did get a good view of osaka up until the sea but the capsule is pretty small. My husband who is 6’2 was having space issue, it was definitely built for japanese people. Overall, worth the money
2;Smaller than other in Tokyo;If you are traveling from Tokyo to Osaka then you should not try this. In Tokyo you have Kasai Rinkai Park and odaiba park fairies wheel which is much much better than this. This is not value for money at all.
2;Excellent views;We arrived as the ticket booth opened (10am) and didn’t have to wait in any lines. We chose the glass bottom one. It moves slowly so even those with a fear of heights will find it fine. Very clean and the staff were very polite. You must wear masks to ride.
2;Amazing sunset, warm recommendations;We didn’t plan to go at first, but since it’s just next to the aquarium we decided to give it a try. . We came just around the sunset and had an amazing expirience. I’d recommend this to everyone who will be in the neighborhood. . If you’re visiting aquarium, than Ferris Wheel next to it is a must.
2;Must do in Osaka;Awesome views of Osaka and worth the affordable price. Roughly a 15 minute ride and with non stop breathtaking views.
2;Great sights;The Ferris wheel is tall, and I mean tall. It's about a 15 minute ride to make a complete circuit. But the views are amazing. You can choose between a regular capsule or a clear bottom for the same price, so the choice is yours. You can look into Universal Studios and see Hogwarts from the ride. You can also see most of Osaka as well from the ride, and being right on the waterfront at sunset makes the ride all the more romantic.
2;The great 15 minutes Osaka panoramic view;The ideal time to go up to see the scenery is the evening, either before or after the Santa Maria cruise. It's free for both items when showing the Osaka Amazing Pass.
2;View is Amazing!;Definitely a must if you're not afraid of heights. Also, it's free if you decided to get an Osaka Amazing Pass, so make sure you get one. It's really really worth every cent or yen. We heard the line's especially long during the weekends so go on the weekdays, and possibly around 10 when it opens. Ohh it's a bit chilly up there so bring a jacket.
2;Glass bottom carriage is a must;Although it is a longer wait vs the standard carriage, the glass (opaque) bottom adds a different level of excitement to this tall ferries wheel just next to the Aquarium
2;Great view from the top;Well worth a little trip on if your not scared of heights , u get a great view from the top but was pretty windy
3;If you are European or American, DO NOT GO. I left feeling quite depressed. Awful treatment of animals. Makes our zoos at home look like Eden. If you are Japanese, do not go but try to lobby for some change here.;AWFUL animal cruelty
3;Walked in and back out. Saw five animals, this zoo is horrendous. Animal cruelty at its finest! The lion couldn’t even stand, all the animals looked sad. Polar bear pacing around in despair, it mad us feel sad. Do not give this place any money. Can’t believe such humans would treat them like this. Birds too crowded, the whole place smelt like poo. Felt sorry for the wolfs, no clean water and waiting for food. WORST ZOO EVER, disappointed with myself for paying the fee in and not doing research and reading reviews.;Small zoo but worth a visit
3;Tennoji zoo is a small zoo but it has some attractions that are not common. Among them are polar bears, penguins and nocturnal animals such as bats and kiwi birds. It is worth a visit.;Sad zoo
3;The zoo have many exhibits that are no longer active, elephants, koala etc. Unfortunately we found out only after entering. Of those active, the animals seemed well taken care of though mostly caged in relatively small enclosure. I would give it a miss;Loved seeing the red pandas!
3;Love love loved it! The red pandas were super cute! This zoo has a hippo and 2 rhinos! Loved the red pandas. Loved the penguins! Loved the polar bear!;Well maintained zoo in Tennoji
3;The zoo itself is quite nice but definitely lacking in animals and could be better in terms of improving the conditions for many of the animals in the zoo, especially the bears and larger cats. Entry is quite cheap which is ok but wouldn’t mind paying more if it meant better enclosures for all the animals inside.;NO ELEPHANT
3;This zoo which established since 1915 is the part of Tennoji Park with a large area ​​around 7000 square meters. From the main Shinsekai Gate,Tennoji Zoo is divided into two large areas African Savanah and Adia Tropical Rain Forest. For details can be seen in the map given with the entrance ticket. If you are lucky you can also see feeding time at certain hours. I saw some animals have been missing in empty cages.The zoo doesn't have elephant, she died in January 2018.  So sad. And some animals are in too small spaces, in less than ideal conditions. Such as the tiger place in a small glass room. Entrance ticket is ¥ 500 free with Osaka Amazing Pass.This zoo is closes on Mondays. The closest stations are Tenoji Station and Dobutsuen-mae Station with JR Osaka Loop Line, JR Hanwa Line, JR Yamatoji Line, Midosuji Subway Line, and Tanimachi Subway Line.;Very good outing with kids
3;If you are looking for a half day activity to get outdoors in osaka, this is a very good option. The zoo is walkable within a half day and you can see a broad range of animals. What i like about the zoo is that the size is small enough that you can exit the zoo to either eat at a proper Japanese restaurant or bring back some lunch to eat at one of the picnic tables within the zoo. This is not one of the worlds best zoos, but it is a very good alternative to spending more time in shopping malls or streets in Osaka;Do not visit
3;A lot of the animals looked to be living in small, cramped conditions. I was especially concerned about the bears including the polar bear who were showing signs of distress.;Terrible
3;Really sad zoo definitely do not go! The poor animals have terrible enclosures and are exposed to direct sun light with little to no shade. This place needs to be shut down!;Do not fund this zoo by coming - it’s so sad
3;My home zoo is one of the top 10 in the United States, so I was pleasantly surprised by Tennoji Zoo.  We arrived just over an hour before the closing and got a foreigner's discount using our passports.  Some of the animals were going to be put away before closing, but we were still able to see many of them because the zoo has an easy path that gets you around to most of the zoo without having to double back.  I enjoyed seeing the Tanuki (raccoon dog) and the Chinese wolves.  My husband was worried that some of the animal enclosures were small, but I think they were (overall) lovely with lots of ways to see the animals.;Awful zoo
4;So much Fun;Universal Studios was so much fun.  Loved all the details put into Nintendo World.  If you have not been, highly recommend getting the express pass.  Super helpful and saves so much time.
4;Wish I spent my day better;Worst theme park experience at Japan’s Universal Studios. We got early admissions, but there was no point since they were allowing general entrance to enter beforehand too. Since we have an one year old toddler with us, we decided to go on single riders to save time. Single riders were estimating 20 mins of wait time and groups were estimating 45 mins. We went on the single rider line for Spider-Man and was stuck waiting over 30 mins even with only 10 people ahead as we saw hundreds of people pass us on the other line. The staff in charge kept calling pairs and quadruples. Even when there were slots available for single riders, they let the seats be empty instead of calling us. When we brought it to their attention, they just completely ignore us. The management needs to retrain them on their counting skills.
4;Not as busy as people claim;Got lost trying to find the Osaka loop line but eventually got to the park about 815 and people were already riding the rides on a Monday. The bag search is not very thorough so put food at the bottom. No x ray machine .Remember to register your park passes on your app so that when through the gate you can select entry time for Super Nintendo world . We had about three time slots left to choose from and chose 11:20 . It didn’t happen to us but I assume you could be left disappointed if you didn’t do this. Park very busy ,went straight to flying dinosaur and waited about 20 minutes . You have to put your items in a locker half way through the queue . They give you ticket and also metal detect your whole body . Did someone get killed by a loose item in the past ? They are very hot on this. Later on I gave my bags to my partner and rode the ride again. It saved me a few minutes not having bags the second time. We got into Nintendo world on time at 11:20 and despite it being mega busy by 11:52 we had ridden Mario kart ride. The queues dip unpredictably. If they dip on the app that causes a surge to that ride so use the app as a guide where not to go sometimes. Harry Potter forbidden journey displayed 70 mins but we rode on single rider in 10 mins. You have to ask for single rider but it’s sometimes very good option. Minion mayhem has 3 video pre shows which take ages. We did 13 rides including 17:30 waterworld show. Staff are very friendly we got given a sticker at Jurassic food place for being our first visit . . Highlights include :. Jaws (classic ride) Spider man  Flying dinosaur  Jurassic park ( not converted to Jurassic world .yet fortunately) Hollywood dream. Longest queue was probably Hollywood dream at 45 minutes . Everything else was shorter and we walked on spider man at 18:45ish. The merchandise is really not my style . The t shirts are just not right . You can’t get anything as simple as a universal studios Japan shirt or Super Nintendo world shirt . They try to stylise them and make them kind of cool which takes the ironic cringe of theme park shirts away . Which is actually what I like . . I was disappointed terminator 2 :3D was shut down. You can see the sign but ride doesn’t look like it’s coming back. There’s no hint of the Simpsons they must not like them here at all. They like snoopy though. 
4;Do once to experience it;We went specifically for Harry Potter World for the teens, and to check out the new Super Nintendo World. Was a school day and rainy, so crowds weren't huge but wait queues were up to 75 mins. Using an express pass 7, as only way to get the two areas abovementioned, was only 10-15 min waits, remember is single use only, so second turn on any ride is back to the end of the queue. Only 2 rides in each of these areas then to buy a ¥5500 each wand and wrist tag to then do the side entertainment (after queueing). Main rides in each area were good but second rides were targeting under 12, so basic rides. Visited other areas and rides too and even though themed per area, had same feel as about half rides are 3/4D. Very expensive place to visit, all up approximately ¥25000 per person.. Worth the visit once, much prefer Disneyland/sea for a return trip
4;The best Universal Studio of all Universal Studios;With the addition of the Super Mario land, USJ has become an instant hit spot. Make. Sure to buy the express pass package or expect to stand in line for all. Of the popular rides for over 90 minutes, some. Over 3 hours
4;Buy the express ticket;Had a fun day. Park was busy, Express tickets meant waiting times of 0-15 mins instead of 90 mins, so highly recommended. Download the app, it is very helpful.
4;Crowded and noisy;Very crowded, loud music everywhere. The ticket system for express pass gives a timed entry for the different areas, and not just the individual activities. There is NO flexibility. The staff will not let you into a specific area outside your time range, regardless your reason for asking. You can only enter an area in the time interval stated on your ticket. Staff is friendly and the place is clean.
4;Closes too early;Visited USJ on a non peak day but the park is quite crowded. We skipped the early morning queues with people trying to get into the park earlier and reached there at 11am. 😅. Quite late but we have got the express pass so still managed to get into Harry Potter and Super Nintendo world. Highly recommend the Butterbeer at Harry Potter’s! It’s really good! . At Mario world, you will need to get a power up band at additional cost to play other mini games (with long Qs) in the Mario park. My daughter had fun with that though.. We had lunch at Jurassic World where there were enough seatings and it was not so crowded. . Did not managed to try many other rides of course as we were late and with the Qs, but still had fun with the games and won a snoopy toy. The only thing is the park closes at 7pm on that day we went. That actually caught us by surprise. I mean how can a theme park close at such an early time.
4;Kids under teen loved it.  Others happy enough;I think this is a better park for younger kids rather than teens and adults.  . Has some problems but the kids love it.   Great experience for them and fine for adults as well.   We paid a lot extra for some express tickets so we are lucky to be able to do everything we’d want in one day.   . The food was ordinary.  The rides were good.
4;Great family day out;Got there at 8.30 and park was fully open…which surprised us!. Managed to book entry to Nintendo world…but not Harry Potter. Rides were brilliant. Longest queue was 50 minutes for Hollywood Dreams “Backdrop”. We had already whizzed through the normal Hollywood Dreams ride twice and actually this was probably better!. Only a 15 minute wait time for The Flying Dinosaur which was superb!. Staff were very friendly and excellent. Only 4 stars because we couldn’t get into Harry Potter World. (Single Rider Q’s were as long as normal Q’s so not worth the bother). We attended on a Wednesday so maybe that made a difference to Queue times…
4;Dishonest! Misleading! Don't go, because you not see Mario!;I'm a fan of amusement parks and I've been to more than a dozen, including Orlando (including Universal Studios) and Universal Studios Singapore.  Certainly the US of Japan is the WORST among all the parks I've been to!!!.  I went there exclusively to see the Super Mario World attraction, but getting a ticket to the restricted area (from the Super Mario World area) seems like mission impossible!  Let's understand: this ticket is already paid for, but it is not guaranteed that you will get it.  You can only book the Mario area ticket after you enter the park with your standard ticket.  I went on a Thursday and the park opened at 08:00 to close at 22:00.  I arrived at the park at 08:00, but as there were already huge queues to enter the park, I only managed to enter and validate my standard ticket at 08:30.  When I went to book the Super Mario World ticket on the app, there was only room for 9:30 pm!  I booked.  I looked for an attendant at the entrance to Mario's area and he pointed me to an area in the park where you can book tickets for Mario's area.  With the bad signage it was difficult to get there.  And why put this area away from the attraction?  Arriving there, close to 09:00, there were no more tickets for Mario!  You could pick a number (lucky ticket) to be drawn in case someone gives up at that time that came out on your lucky ticket.  To top it off I couldn't get a lucky ticket, because I had already booked from 21:30.  If the park closed at 22:00 and the queues lasted 2 hours, I would not be able to go to any attraction inside.  I explained to an attendant, but he said he couldn't cancel to try the lucky ticket and I asked what I could do inside at this late hour.  He said: take pictures.  Hahahaha  It's so ridiculous that if you don't get this ticket you don't see Mario at all.  Stay hidden!.  Let's go to the rest of the park:  Average queue length of 2 hours for best rides.  I saw 4 hour queues on the app!  I didn't even try to go.  The longest I caught was 2 hours and 30 minutes.  Don't be fooled by the beautiful facades of the toys, on the side, well hidden, there will be a giant zigzag for the queue, looking like a very ugly slaughterhouse, because there were a lot of people slaughtered.  Rsss  Queue for food more than 1 hour to be seated and still time to order, apart from preparation.  Queue for the bathroom 30 minutes, don't go tight to the queue.  :0.  Restroom, locker, and attraction signage is poor.  There are almost no signs in the park and the accuracy of the map in the app is low.  With no attendant outside the rides, it can take 30 minutes to find something.  Team "Sorry":  Attendants are unable to communicate in English.  They only know how to say "Sorry".  Perfect for the park. Universal from USA and Singapore were my benchmark for quality.  I don't know how Universal leaves their mark on something so poorly done.  I've been to dozens of parks of this size and I've never seen such horror.  Even the day I went to Hopi Hari in Brazil was more fun.  The attractions don't compare, but what's the use of having interesting attractions if you can't even see them (Mario's area) or just stand in line?  Maybe they were just made to attract the unsuspecting.  After the park has received the ticket money from the unsuspecting (very expensive by the way) the fun is for them.  Do not create expectations.  Impractical food and souvenir prices.  And they don't allow you to bring in food or drink.  They sell more tickets than the park can handle to be fun.  Don't be fooled by the Universal Express (more expensive ticket to take shorter queues) .  More than double the amount (approximately 270.00 USD) to ride once in some attractions scheduled by them.  And don't miss the schedule, because they are good at stopping you.  Remember Sorry. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!.  In the USA there is already a Super Mario World area so we'll see you there! 
4;Great, Fun Day During Peak Season;The visit to Universal Studios Japan during our March 2023 trip marks our third time visiting Universal Studios Japan. This visit however was the visit to USJ where we encountered the biggest crowd (apparently it was the holiday period) and one of our previous visit was during the Christmas holiday period. For this visit, the three of us were targeting entry into the Super Nintendo World. We ran out of tickets to go into this section when ordering the tickets so we went instead with normal tickets and showed up early, the information being that USJ unofficially opens an hour quicker than the time it states on its website. So the USJ's official opening hour being 8 AM, it was already open at 7 AM, and a large crowd had already gathered, this being the holiday period. We managed to get in, went straight in the direction of Super Nintendo World and bumped into some ushers telling us to get some time-assigned tickets to get into Super Nintendo World from some machines. This was what we did and we got some tickets to get into Super Nintendo World at 12.45 PM. It is a new ride and it is very popular so the way to get in without a pre-booked ticket is a bit convoluted and some luck is involved but it is worth it. Until that time there was a lot of looking around to do. It gets crowded very quickly. The first ride we lined up for was Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey. Though it was morning, it was already a good 75 minute queue. By the time we actually got to Super Nintendo World at 1 PM, the queue to go on the ride there was a good 2 hours. The saving grace of this queueing experience is that it is orderly and the line does move but if you are going on a popular ride or a popular section, expect long lines. . Overall it's a great fun day but do try to avoid visiting during Japan's holiday period if you want to avoid crowds. The shorter lines are usually for the little kids' rides or some of the less popular rides (though that doesn't make them any less enjoyable, I always have a soft spot for the Terminator rides). I will say that the experience of going on the rides here is well worth the queue but do expect long lines, there's just no getting around it. Sitting down to eat and drink was out of the question on this day because it was that crowded so we settled for buying food from the foodstalls inside the theme park. The can't miss food at USJ during the visits I've been on over the years is the turkey leg which looks like a club and has a lot of meat on it. On a crowded day like the day I visited, it was a 1 hour queue before we got the food. I think about 3 PM onwards, it becomes less crowded but there's still a lot of people around if the crowds at the Universal City station is any indication. The USJ closes at 10 PM but I would recommend getting out earlier to avoid getting stuck in the rush to leave the USJ.
5;Just another mall with Ferris wheel at the top;What I like about this mall is that I can get the Manhattan portage bag for almost half the price online. What more I get it tax free though the lady at one of the shop was rude when I requested for a new piece and to check before purchase. She kept asking for my passport and mentioned that the piece I’m holding is already new when it was a display piece. Kinda sad because I always hear people say that the locals there are polite. Oh well maybe just this lady. Also if u like crayon shinchan, there’s a shop here though kinda small. . Apart from that just regular mall that sells clothes, bags, etc with quite a lot of young people.
5;Great place for girls watching;Depending on your objective. Great place for bird watching, I mean girls watching. After all it’s a mall filled with young females and shops dedicated to this clientele. Otherwise you have other time to spend time with.
5;Whales!;This shopping mall is aimed very much at teenagers and younger adults, but is worth a quick visit, whatever your age, to see the enormous red whales hanging in the atrium area! There is also a ferris wheel on the roof..
5;Simple ferris wheel;This was really simple, fine for a short ride but you do not actually see much. Go to one of the nice towers - example Harukas 300 and enjoy the view from there. Unless you are already in Umeda and near it otherwise I would not recommend a trip for it. :) Cheers!
5;A good way to enjoy Osaka skyline;A unique way to enjoy the Osaka skyline. There was no queue and buying the tickets was a breeze. I would recommend going there in the evening for the sunset or at night to enjoy the city lights.
5;Wheel turn;It’s a wonderful shopping mall with lots of clothing’s and accessories with a Ferris wheel on top of the roof. Its free ride if you have bought the two day transport pass. So don’t miss the chance to see the best view.
5;Buy lucky bag/ happy bag on new year day;So many young people came for lucky bag/ happy bag at hep five !!!  I got few as well. Some staffs of the shops were not friendly when they heard foreigners asked for tex free ( cuz took longer process).  But anyway, you can get the happy bag of most popular brands here in Osaka.
5;Another shopping paradise;This is yet another shopping paradise which is more suitable for teenagers who made up the majority of the people I have seen in this mall. There is also a ferris wheel on top of the mall.
5;Shopping mall popular with the youth;This is a multi storey mall with a ferris wheel on top. It appears to be popular with the young and there is a games arcade here. Short walk from Umeda. The Joypolis wild river ride is also located here.  Plenty of stores selling clothes and also lots of dining and entertainment options.
5;Mundane shopping centre for the young  famous for the two red whale models;This shopping and restaurant complex in Umeda is famous for the two mother and calf sperm whales in red. It also has a partly indoor ferris wheel . A large VR entertainment centre is also in the same building. Thats about it.
6;Great views and interesting design;Amazing views of Osaka from the top of these two towers linked by a circular walkway. Recommend watching the Timelapse video of them raising the central walkway and securing it with large steel plates
6;39th floor for free;Visited around lunchtime and hoped to get a drink in the sky lounge. Unfortunately, this doesn't open until 17:00, entrance to the 39th floor is free, you only have to pay to enter the observation deck on the 40th. Decided the price for one extra floor wasn't worth it. Nice little basement with many little cafes, done in a rather twee olde worldy style, but worth a look if you want a drink or snack and the lounge at the top isn't open
6;Amazing building;If you have a few days to spare in Osaka spending the evening around Umeda and check out the lovely vistas you get from top of this building.
6;It was OK, nothing spectacular..;This was included in our Osaka amazing pass - we went at sunset right before 6pm.  The view was OK, you definitely see the entire Umeda vicinity but you'll see better sunset in Hawaii, and better landmarks from the Shard in London.  So it was just OK. I do appreciate the architecture, design, however., and I particularly loved looking up from the ground at the building more than looking at the city from the open deck on the top. The escalators are cool.
6;Fun while it was free, now overpriced;This used to be a fun free experience. Now it’s rather overpriced. The view isn’t particularly special and the building isn’t even the highest in its direct vicinity. There are better ways to spend your 1500 Yen.
6;Open top 360-views!;Beautiful views on a clear day. The open/ outdoor top floor offered great views with full feel of the weather elements without glass hindrance. This made the experience very enjoyable. One could stay here for hours and enjoy the day and sunset views. The floor below has a cafe and counter sears which offers nearly 180 deg window views. Great spot for young couples or a lovely evening out. Wish we had gone sooner as would have love to sit there for a day with coffee and tea and idle some time with a good book and great sky views.
6;Escalator ride between towers;The best part about the Umeda Building is the escalator ride between the towers.  I was actually expecting it to be windy during the escalator ride, but it is enclosed with glass.  The windy part is walking on the rooftop.  They have a section at the top where you can leave a lock like they do at the Brooklyn Bridge.  A little pricey for the observation deck, considering that the Government Building Observatory deck is free.  Not sure If I'd go back.  Once is enough.
6;Umeda Sky building;This is an amazing architectoral building and we were lucky that they were having a cultural festival in their courtyard.   Beautiful flower gardens and water areas to walk through.
6;Landmark building of Osaka;the building is absolutely amazing, very unique and iconic. easy to access from train station and near five star hotel and mall
6;Beautiful city view;Umeda Sky Building is a signature architecture for it’s beautiful city view from the observatory desk in Shin Umeda City. . The route from the top level to the observatory desk was kind of confusing but the staff was friendly and helpful. The escalators covered with transparent windows were famous but super scary. . There is a Japanese traditional garden located on lower level which is surprisingly nice to me.
6;FREE for Osaka Amazing Pass;You may come to this Umeda Sky Building and go to upper for FREE if you have Osaka Amazing Pass. The view is really amazing especially during night.
6;Come if you have the Osaka Amazing Pass;We came to Osaka at the beginning of all public closure. Umeda sky building was one of the few which got spared.  We have purchased the 2-day Osaka Amazing Pass, so the admission to this place was free. (For folks visiting Osaka, we highly recommend getting the pass, we have gotten great value using it). It is a futuristic building from outside, about 10mins walk from Umeda station. There was some tunnels and stairs with no escalator leading to it. There may be ways to maneuver around but we didn't find any easy access. . Once you get there, it is elevator all the way to the admission entrance, then a couple of escalators. There is a bar with snacks at the entry level with really clean restrooms. You can get 360 degrees unobstructed view of Osaka when you get to the very top observation deck. We wish we came at night because I bet the city is gorgeous all lit up. With the Osaka Amazing Pass you also get access to the art museum over at the East Tower, which was another feast for the eyes.
7;Green lung of Osaka;While Osaka is a hugely touristy city with crowds swamping into major attractions, this pleasant park is the perfect escape from urban bust. Amid modern skyscrapers comes a collection of lawns, fountain and unparalleled panorama of the city. Nakanoshima Park remains serene and peaceful all day.
7;Relaxation in the heart of Osaka;Osaka is quite an intense city so taking some time to relax is always a good idea. Nakanoshima Park allows you to do just that, it's an island on the river with some blossom trees and a rose garden a great place to relax.
7;Old-style Buildings;Walk around the building and you will love the façade and its details, with a view of the river to add pleasurable experience. March 2015
7;Beautiful rivers from both side;This Park provide very nice walkways, beautiful garden. It was very neat and orderly. The park was quiet and peace.
7;Rivers on Both Sides;Great park with nice walkways, beautiful Rose Garden (depending on the time of year), Sandwiched between Dojima Gawa and Tosobori Gawa. There is even a BBQ Restaurant and Beer Garden.
7;Nice stroll. Best during Spring-Summer.;Lovely stroll close to plenty of stations (Yodoyabashi, Nakanoshima, Tenmabashi..) and to a very nice shopping street (Tenjinbashi-suji). The are itself is pretty well located and offers you some interesting museums, architecture (at least you should visit the former Osaka town hall) and a beuatiful rose garden very well kept during the periods mentioned above. Not a must-visit place but if you want to relax and stroll in a quiet area but just a few minutes from the bustling Osaka, it's your place.
7;Clear your mind here;The walk along nakanoshima park was very nice, not crowded with so many people, breath the air along the river next to the park
7;People-watching at the green oasis of downtown Osaka;The park itself is nothing special. Located at the eastern end of Naka-no-shima, an island in the middle of a river, visiting it on a Sunday gave me a nice opportunity to watch Osaka residents at leisure. The park has several sections, including lawns and a rose garden, with views of office skyscrapers and elevated expressways all around. There was a constant hum of traffic noise (as to be expected), but you'll soon be able to ignore that. People were just enjoying the green space on picnic mats and tents, playing badminton, practising yoga or kicking a ball around. Others were bicycling the pathways or rafting up and down the rivers. There's a cafe with bathrooms in the park, near the rose garden. I simply walked there from Osaka railway station and the Ohatsu-tenjin temple, but if you're coming from further and taking the metro, the nearest metro station is Kitahama station on the Sakaisuji Line. The park is just north of the station. On the day that I visited, the sky was cloudy throughout, and at one point threatened to rain. My fall-back plan should it rain was to visit the Museum of Oriental Ceramics just west of the park on Nakanoshima island. In the end, it didn't rain so I didn't visit the museum, but it was good to have this Plan B in mind.
7;Pretty and lovely park;It is pretty and lovely rose garden located on an island along the Okawa river with the skyscraper in the background. It is a quiet and peaceful place which is great for a stroll in the morning or late afternoon. Highly recommended.
7;Green lung of Osaka downtown;This lovely park located on Nakanoshima Island is the green lung of the downtown area. Against the backdrop of surrounding skyscrapers, waterways and criss-crossing skyways and bridges, this park is perfect for your mobile camera whichever way you look. Amidst the blooming roses and lush greeneries which adds to the serenity and peacefulness, this is the perfect place for an evening stroll and to mentally recharge after a tiring walk around town.
8;Must visit magnificent castle.;Magnificent and glorious, Nijo castle stands tall with the beauty of water surrounding it and excellent greenery all around There is a park section as well as the castle.Lots of bright flowering trees brighten up the castle.Plenty of  well maintained greenery all around the castle.Highly recommended !!
8;Confusing signs and useless maps;A great attraction but the experience is completely ruined by confusing and misleading signs and lack of helpful information. Most sign boards and maps inside the big area don't have a where you are sign, without it, it's completely useless. If tourists can locate themselves on a map easily, they don't need a map.  the last boat ride stops at 430pm, the ticket office closed way before two departures.  The most ridiculous part is Nishinomaru park only has one entrance and exit, which was blocked by lots of advertisements and easily missed, and in a number other places around the park, which an entrance could be opened, it had a sign saying access is not possible, so the tourists had to walk around the entire castle loop looking for the entrance and it takes at least 30 minutes to walk half a loop. All places close at 5pm sharp, making it impossible to visit all attractions within a few hours
8;Magnificent Castle;We were staying in Kyoto and made the short trip to Osaka specifically to see Osaka Castle. Arriving by taxi near to the moat, the route to the castle is approached through tree filled gardens and several interesting buildings. The castle looks magnificent, on its plinth of huge boulders. We did not have enough time to visit the inside, but the visit was still worthwhile.
8;So-so;As one reviewer said, it’s not worth going in here. It looks impressive from the outside. It’s a modern reconstruction. Inside is a bit cheesy museum.  Says no photos on floor 3-4, but the artifacts aren’t really worthy of a photo anyway.   The only advantage of going in is to take a photo from the observatory deck There is a cute shrine beside the castle which is free We ate at the little mall on the park premises.  Food was good We didn’t go into the park but people say that it’s worth to visit?!
8;Reminiscing Japanese heritage and culture;This is a place where one can reminisce Japanese heritage and culture. The architecture of the castle is beautiful and has lush greenery in the vicinity. Enjoy the stroll to the castle as it’s akin to walk in the park as one enjoys the breeze and beauty of the surrounding.
8;This is one of the most beautiful castles I’ve ever seen;This castle jumps out at you. It’s very quiet and unassuming, and it takes your breath away. It is very beautiful from all sides. The grounds surrounding the castle are absolutely stunning.
8;Architecturally pretty castle;Attractive castle, also on top is an ex military building and shrine to the castle founder. Popular with the selfie brigade, makes interesting watching Based on other reviews didn't actually enter the castle building.
8;A nice day out;Nearly 1 hour queue to get in there. I went there during Sakura and a glorious day.. that might explain the long line. To be totally honest, I do not think it's worth the wait to get in there. Don't get me wrong, there's a nice exhibition where you can learn tons of things about the castle, but if you are not into history just stroll at leisure around the castle grounds.
8;Cool rebuild of the original;Osaka Castle is a rebuild of the original, the complex is pretty huge with some good gardens. I would say it is worth seeing but Himeji is definitely the one to see if you only get chance to visit one.
8;Beautiful castle even the replica;We cam in a good weather day and the path leading to the castle with many Sakura tree line up with all flowers. Very impressive. We did not go in the Castle as It takes a long queue to wait but we enjoyed walking around and taking some pictures
9;Great atmosphere;My girlfriend and I were going to Sumiyoshi Taisha but found this place on our way. The place was fantastic, though we went there during autumn. Nearby were lots of local vendors for us to grab on some souvenirs. Recommended for those who are looking for a  place with relaxed atmosphere and local vibe.
9;Adjacent to Kohama Shopping Street. Food food food!;After spending two hours at the Sumiyoshitaisha Shrine, on the opposite side of the railway tracks, we found Sumiyoshi Park. There were heaps of families having picnics in the gardens due to the start of Golden Week. Lots of places for kids and toddlers to play around, but for me, the main attraction was the Kohama Shopping Street right between this park and the Station.  It was packed with local vendors..just what you've been looking for. Secondhand bric a brac, fruit and vegies straight from someone's garden, and prepared grilled chicken, or sashimi and sushi. Check out my pics for some fantastic eats which were so cheap in comparison to the big cities, and the amount of seafood packed into the sashimi!! As you exit the station, turn right and you'll see the park, turn right again, and you'll come across the entrance to the wonderful shopping street, undercover of course.
9;Eye-candy garden!;If you're having a vacation in Osaka prefecture then pay a visit to Sumiyoshi Park. The view is just fantastic! I'm lucky it's spring season/cherry blossoms season so the flowers of different species are fully bloomed! There's a playground in the park, a picnic area and just endless view of beautiful flowers. It is also just few walks away from the Sumiyoshi station so it's very convenient to visit. The only letdown was the "man-made" pond wasn't mainted well so you'll notice some unfriendly smell coming from it.
9;Pleasant surprise;I cam across this park after my visit to the Sumiyoshi shrine known for its beautiful bridge. It is located beside the shrine and I believe was actually part of the temple grounds before. Even more surprising is that over a century ago the park and the shrine were next to the ocean! It is landlocked now but it must have been a pretty beautiful location then. When I was tther the sakura was not in bloom, only about 2 trees! But what the surprise was the presence of several varieties of herons which were on the rooftop, bridges, trees and the grounds.
10;Lively Weekend Park Visit;My family had decided to steer clear of the shopping area, especially since it’s the weekend. It was one of the best choices made. Though there was a crowd in the park, everything was still rather serene. Families soaking in the sun while having picnics. young boys having their futsal game. It was just a joy to be there with the locals.
10;Beautiful park!;It was so beautiful there. There are storks, ginko trees and pretty bridge. I’m imagining it’ll be beautiful during spring and autumn!
10;Nice park in Tennoji;A pleasant park to stroll in. You'll find a small zoo, Japanese garden with a pond and few museums. Saw many families having a good time there.
10;Fairly large park;Came in spring and walked around this park after visiting the zoo. Fairly large area with a museum here. As we stayed in Tennoji area, we also visited at night and there were some activities and small stalls open. Near Tennoji station. We were looking for cherry blossoms but didn't see many in this area. Maybe we were too early.
10;Awesome park, nice atmosphere.;A long nice park with a great history. There is a grass area with bars/restaurants and round the side has a lake with fountains, a bit of history about the Battle of Tennoji too.
10;Nice Stroll;It’s a small park not far from the Tennoji Station. Cherry blossoms also aplenty. There is a zoo a museum and a garden here. If you want to visit all of them expect to spend a few hours. It made for a good relaxing stroll here. There are plenty of shops and restaurants nearby.
10;Better every month.;Tennoji Park has changed a lot in the recent years. It used to be a very old and dirty area (not even the Shôwa charm). But now, the conditions of the Tennôji station and its surroundings have considerably improved. You've got some coffee shops (STBCKS and others), as well as some leisure activities (Captain Tsubasa footbal school) and you can realx and play in the grass with friends and kids. Even though I do not enjoy zoos, you've got the Osaka Zoo (Tennôji Zoo) right there, which can be an option as a date spot or to teach your kids that animals should be in their natural habitats (forgive me the pun). All in all, the place seems to get better day by day and it's full of seasonal recreational activities (sometimes a zip line, sometimes some small shows..).  You have a 3 big shopping malls (Mio, Harukas and Q's) less than 3 minutes away, and the enormous Abeno Harukas (tallest building -non tower structured- in the world), and you are 10 minutes away to Shitennôji and Shinsekai-Tsûtenkaku -AKA the weird flashy lovely Osaka Tower-(OMG) on foot so it's a great area to see another part of Osaka.
10;Lovely park;Stumbled across this park while walking close to my hotel. It was a weekend and full of families, and had a really great atmosphere and lots of little restaurants and cafes.
10;Peaceful Safehouse;Great place to detox from work, if you live here, or to kill time in between trains. Located 10 mins from Tennoji station, you'll find small eats and coffee ( Tully's ) here. Also, the zoo and Keitakuen Garden are located here.
10;Nice park for a picnic;I happened to pass by this park and saw a lot of locals having picnic at this park. Many brought their children out as well. Great place to chill especially during an autumn afternoon.
11;Great park for a wander;This a great park, even in winter for a wander. The fountain is shut for the season but there are still plenty of activities going on - people playing tennis and the world game / soccer. Lovely Maple at the west end.
11;Large rose garden;Nice green space in the middle of busy Hommachi. There are several areas to enjoy, such as a kid's play area, a huge rose garden, and a soccer field with surrounding cherry blossoms. Very well frequented by Osaka urbanites looking for a place to chill out. The creek-like fountain is full of kids cooling off in the summer heat which, while technically prohibited, is allowed.. although some families take advantage of this by allowing their kids to use water guns etc. Good place for people watching, lots of wannabe models getting photos taken near the roses (or trying to without backgroud people ruining the shot, which is hilarious).  I don't recommend the park bathrooms, as is usual in Japan. Only if you're desperate, otherwise walk to the nearest 7-11 instead. Lots of restaurants nearby, and convenience stores, for quick bites.
11;Green park;During our visit we came across this park by chance and we felt at peace once inside. Trees, greenery, decks. Beautiful and calm small park.
11;A park with GRASS!;Utsubo-koen is a great place to escape the city for a bit. It has a wonderful rose garden and some shade under the trees which is a popular spot for families and groups of friends to spend time together. There are some nice cafés along the edge of the park.
11;Awesome for families/kids;This is my favorite park for my wife and I to go picnic.   When the weather i warm, there is a fountain area for kids and parents to splash around and have fun.  Be ADVISED, it's free and the kids will never want to leave!   I believe it was the site of a former landing strip during WW2.   Popular at cherry blossom viewing time in late March/early April.   Easy access by subway.  I can't heap praise enough about this wonderful green space.
11;Small oasis;Small compare to other parks but it is sufficient to provide a resting place for Osaka residence  Sandpit playground for kids , benches and some statues of representing love makes the park very family orientated  Great place
11;Wonderfully peaceful place to bring your dog or just sit by the pond;This park is really nice for sitting and relaxing in. There are a bunch of people who bring their little dogs here to walk and play with them, and I found it incredibly soothing to stay by the pond on the mid-east side. You can play tennis here, too. there are courts in the eastern part. If you want huge fields to play soccer in, Ogimachi Park up north might be a better choice, but I liked this park better for its homey feel.
11;My first sakura;Visited this park during my first spring visit in Japan. Here in this park is where I encounter with my very first sakura and witness japanese doing their Hanami under sakura trees.
12;Nice local park.;We paused whilst trekking between destinations. It's just a beautiful local park with nice paths, good spots to sit and a public toilet that saved our lives!
12;THIS PLACE IS VERY INTERESTING;This place is very interesting. There are museum in front and the park at the back. It was worth it going here. I am a nature lover so, this place is more interesting than going to Umeda or Namba. You can relax here with you family. The admission fee is cheap. 300 yen for both the park and the museum. I love this place.
12;Charming Park;Located near Nagai station, you can visit this park as well as the Museum of natural history using the Osaka Amazing pass.  Very relaxing to take a walk around. Fairly large park with seasonal flowers.
12;Lovely place to relax;While visiting my daughter, we took a bike ride to Nagai Park. Actually saw a late blooming cherry tree! We had some yummy bakery items we bought from across the street and sat down to watch retired folks playing some type of game that combined golf and croquet on a flat dirt field. Looked fun. I rode around a bit and found some people playing guitar and a traditional Japanese stringed instrument. The huge sports complex and stadium is nearby as well. A nice place to relax.
12;Beautiful Local Park - worth visiting;This park is near to the stadium and can be reached by taking the midosuji line. Takes about 10mins brisk walk from the station - 0.8km away. . Entrance fee is 200yen for an adult . Worth the money as the park is very scenic . It has a rose garden which I have experienced . . Please visit their museum and explore the whole place . I was fascinated by the animal/plants/insect specimen which will be interesting for children to visit .
12;A Charming Park like an Oasis in the Big City;This is a charming and beautiful park which includes a large lagoon and museum. When you are in the park you can walk along the way and sense a peaceful and quiet atmosphere. You will see swans and see turtles swimming in the lagoon. Also, a large garden with tall palm trees and a water fountain rising high over the park while you enjoy serenity. You should consider to spend at least a couple hours including the visit to the museum.
12;Beautiful trees, needed a good mow though;Enjoyed walking through the park, spectacular trees but needed a really good weed and mow by Australian standards.
12;A great place to stroll.;This park was just down the road from our accommodation, so we visited here on our last full day in Osaka. We walked around the outer region of the park first and then paid the 200 yen each admission and went in the botanical gardens. We really enjoyed these gardens. They are well set out with different garden areas everywhere. We particularly enjoyed the rose garden, the Japanese iris garden and the fernery areas around the lake with little pathways, a stream and rockeries. Well worth visiting the gardens for sure.
12;Lovely place for jogging;Absolutely great place for having a rest or jogging. Dont forget to take a camera with you, the garden is lovely especially in spring. There is a Botanical Garden and Museum in the centre of Nagai Park.
12;Trees in Osaka. Great place to exercise;Nagai has a lot to offer for everyone. There is a restaurant, Life super market, and a great bakery next to Nagai park. I always buy raison loaf, apple pie, and a roll topped with a generous portion of egg. Inside Nagai has a pool only during hot parts of summer A sumo ring Two stadiums A running road going all around the park Middle of the park has a lake filled with turtles, geese, and cranes. It's a natural area packed with pretty flowers. Aesthetics over function. Good luck finding a fruit tree. Went there to go running around the track. And there is an exercise area for stretching, playing soccer, playing Frisbee, and strength training. Osaka is not known for it's natural areas within the city. Nagai park is a notable exception along with Osaka castle. It's about 25 minutes by train south of Tennoji. Maybe 40 minutes from Namba. Just jump on the midosuji (red) line
12;Nice setting Park;An Oasis in Osaka.  Easy access.  Winter/Christmas Illumination from dusk is fascinating.  Flowers are of good variety.
13;Osaka;Japan
14;A shrine associated with the Sanada family;The shrine is located near Tamatsukuri Station. It is located in the corner of Sanadamaru, where Yukimura Sanada encamped as the outlying castle of Osaka Castle, and there are exhibits related to Yukimura. The bronze statue is quite splendid, and a place called Sanada's Hole is also located nearby, making it an interesting place for history buffs.
14;I noticed for the first time that there is a big cherry tree called "Sanko Sakura" in the precincts of the shrine.;The last time I visited in December 2015 and January-December 2016, there were many worshippers in the temple grounds due to the "NHK Taiga: Sanadamaru," but this time in September 2022, six years after the "NHK Taiga: Sanadamaru," there were no visitors. On the other hand, I noticed for the first time that there is a large cherry tree called "Sanko Sakura (Sanko Cherry Blossom)" in the temple grounds.　I would like to visit again next time when the cherry trees are in full bloom to see how the atmosphere of the temple has changed.
14;It is full of Yukimura Sanada!;The shrine is located in the place where Sanadamaru is said to have been established. It is a 10-minute walk from JR Tamatsukuri Station.
14;Yukimura Sanada's loophole;This shrine is dedicated to Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi and Susanoo-no-Mikoto, and is located on the Uemachi Plateau where Sanadamaru was established during the Osaka Winter Campaign. A loophole, which is said to have been dug from Osaka Castle to Sanadamaru, remains under the shrine grounds. As historical research progresses, details of the location of Sanadamaru (Meisei Gakuen) and the hole under the shrine (a trench dug when Sanadamaru was attacked?) have become known. However, from a historical and romantic point of view, the loophole in Sanadamaru is better.
14;A shrine that lifts our spirits;The shrine is famous for its association with Yukimura Sanada, and the temple grounds are lined with many banners with the six-figure coin, and there is a bronze statue of Yukimura Sanada to lift one's spirits.
14;Osaka Seven Lucky Gods Tour" begins!;A statue of Jurojin stands in the precincts of the shrine, which is the start of the "Osaka Shichifukujin Meguri (Osaka Seven Lucky Gods Tour). The statue of Jurojin was not so prominent, but the statue of Yukimura Sanada standing by the stone steps of the approach to the shrine stood out.
14;associated with Yukimura Sanada;It is said to be a loophole between Sanadamaru and Osaka Castle, but the true meaning is not certain? Nearby is a cemetery for soldiers of the former Japanese Army.
14;Shrine with Sanada's loophole;The shrine is located about a 7-minute walk from Tamatsukuri Station. Since it is located in front of Sanadamaru, there are many people associated with Sanada. The shrine also has a loophole that leads to Osaka Castle.
14;Kuil di Tamatsukuri;Saat kami jalan-jalan disekitar Station Tamatsukuri tanpa sengaja menemukan lokasi Senko Shrine yang bangunannya masih tampak kokoh sekali
14;Sanadamaru Ruins;In Osaka, Yukimura Sanada is digging into this secret road, and it will be opened in November, dedicated to the shrine, Yukimura Sanada.
14;Shrine associated with Yukimura Sanada;A 5-minute walk from JR Tamatsukuri Station.  The origin seems to be old, but it is said to be the place where the Sanada Maru where Lord Yukimura Sanada bravely fought against the Tokugawa forces in the Osaka Winter Siege in the early Edo period.  Prince Yukimura is one of the most popular Sengoku warlords.  It is also said that Lord Yukimura made a loophole leading from Osaka Castle to this Sanko Shrine.  There are also traces left under the precincts.  It is a recommended spot for worship and historical walks.
14;Made famous by the historical drama "Taiga Drama;It became famous in the NHK Taiga drama "Sanada Maru".  Originally called Himeyama Shrine, it was the only shrine in Japan to ward off paralysis (symptoms caused by cerebral hemorrhage, such as hemiplegia and paralysis of limbs). that's right.  At the Osaka Winter Siege of the Toyotomi and Tokugawa sides, This is the Demaru (Demaru) built by Yukimura Sanada of the Toyotomi side on the south side of Osaka Castle Hiranoguchi.  From before and after the broadcast of "Sanada Maru", flags such as Rokumonsen became famous.  There is also a Sanada Yukimura statue and Sanada loopholes in the precincts.  There are historical sites related to Sanada Yukimura in the area, so  I think it would be a good idea to visit when the season is good.
15;The Shrine close to harbor and the Red Bridge;Travelers understand that all shrines are places where Torii red pillars are located and people come to pray for sacred things. This place where the kami (Shinto gods) who protect travelers, fishermen and sailors at sea, is more interesting than anywhere else. Travelers go to the shrine by train and then connect to the local tram. There is the iconic red arch bridge and various shrines to ask for blessings for each purpose. Visitors will see the bowing and the blessing and hear the sound of a coin thrown into the container and the applause in a peaceful atmosphere. Some visitors procure the sacred things from the shrine to protect or help make the wish come true. Some Japanese family  in traditional costumes takes a newborn child to thank the sacred. It's very interesting and impressive.
15;Beautiful bridge;The bridge that leads to the main shrine is an excellent place for photo ops. The pond is beautiful. We went on a weekend and there was no crowd, which was perfect.
15;An impressive traditional shinto shrine;The Sumiyoshi Taisha shrine is the main shrine for all of the Sumiyoshi shrines around Japan. The various buildings of the shrine are spread out around a park-like area, featuring traditional Japanese architecture and landscaping at its purest. You really want to slow down when you enter the area, remembering that this is not just some historical sight, but also a part of a living, breathing religion. With the correct attitude, you can really take in the feel of this place and appreciate the thought that has gone into it. This was my first major shrine in Japan, and it definitely left an impression. Beautiful.
15;Visiting;Omg !!! Amazing and breathtaking . . It is worth all of your time and it’s free to enter . 😛. The grounds are so clean and well keep . . It’s very relaxing and you see all the children in their kimonos . The temple is incredible . So beautiful . . It’s a wonderful insight to Japanese culture and traditions . 🥰. Especially , if you go on the weekend!
15;WEDDING CEREMONY;First time I saw and fortunated to witness Japan Traditional wedding ceremony in this temple . The red Soribashi arch bridge is a link between outside area and inside of the temple. This arch bridge become one of the best photo spot in Kansai. There are several places in Sumiyoshi Taisha. The temple building is different from the other temples in Japan,the roof is triangular in shape or called Sumiyoshi Zukuri like the roof in Shirakawago. The close station is Sumiyoshi Taisa Station on the Nankai Line and use Hankai tram line stop at Sumiyoshitoriimae Station and just walking a few meters.
15;Beautiful Bridge, Nice Surrounding Grounds;I visited the Sumiyoshi Taisha Shrine On June 11th with my two adult sons and my daughter-in-law and I really enjoyed viewing buildings with a different arechitectural design. The structures at this shrine were siad to be built prior to influence from China, and one could see a distinct difference in the shapes of the roof and the ornate fascias. The red bridge was really cool, although a bit hard to walk over without holding on to the guardrail. We walked around the extensive grounds but missed the Cat Shrine. I was trying to find that since my daughter-in-law likes cats. Since it was a very warm day, there were only a few others walking about. We stayed in the shaded areas, did some sight seeing and I collected a goshuin from the Shrine.
15;Real gem of Osaka;This is the answer to experience historic Osaka without the nightmarish tourist crowd. Sumiyoshi Taisha, around twenty-minute train ride from Namba, is a picturesque Shinto shrine to commemorate the god of sea. While the iconic red bridge needs no further introduction, the structure itself is pretty impressive too. Do devote enough time here to stroll around and feel the inner spiritual sublimation.
15;Serene place;It's conveniently situated next to a train station. It was really enjoyable to take a break from the madding crowds of Dotonbori. I went quite early in the morning and it was just a few us. Stroll at leisure and soak in.
15;Very serene and beautiful;If you are looking for something peaceful to do, look no further. There are a million shrines to see in Japan but I enjoyed this one for it's picturesque views.
15;Far from the madding crowds;A calm and peaceful atmosphere in the park with numerous shrines and monuments. You can stroll around at leisure away from the main tourist hot spots. Good food available at the nearby station and another park opposite which is also worth a look for the display of bedding plants, trees in blossom and abundance of herons.
15;Fantastic shrine in south Osaka.;I really loved visiting this shrine this morning. The bridges, buildings, flags, statues and gates here are all stunning. Definitely worth riding the cute little tram down from central Osaka (which is a treat in itself).
15;Beautiful Shrine;This attractive spot is really gorgeous. It is a very old shrine, which was already mentioned in Nihonshoki.  You can see the red bridge and took photo from this bridge.
16;Real gem of Osaka;This is the answer to experience historic Osaka without the nightmarish tourist crowd. Sumiyoshi Taisha, around twenty-minute train ride from Namba, is a picturesque Shinto shrine to commemorate the god of sea. While the iconic red bridge needs no further introduction, the structure itself is pretty impressive too. Do devote enough time here to stroll around and feel the inner spiritual sublimation.
16;Serene place;It's conveniently situated next to a train station. It was really enjoyable to take a break from the madding crowds of Dotonbori. I went quite early in the morning and it was just a few us. Stroll at leisure and soak in.
16;Very serene and beautiful;If you are looking for something peaceful to do, look no further. There are a million shrines to see in Japan but I enjoyed this one for it's picturesque views.

16;The Shrine close to harbor and the Red Bridge;Travelers understand that all shrines are places where Torii red pillars are located and people come to pray for sacred things. This place where the kami (Shinto gods) who protect travelers, fishermen and sailors at sea, is more interesting than anywhere else. Travelers go to the shrine by train and then connect to the local tram. There is the iconic red arch bridge and various shrines to ask for blessings for each purpose. Visitors will see the bowing and the blessing and hear the sound of a coin thrown into the container and the applause in a peaceful atmosphere. Some visitors procure the sacred things from the shrine to protect or help make the wish come true. Some Japanese family  in traditional costumes takes a newborn child to thank the sacred. It's very interesting and impressive.
16;Beautiful bridge;The bridge that leads to the main shrine is an excellent place for photo ops. The pond is beautiful. We went on a weekend and there was no crowd, which was perfect.
16;An impressive traditional shinto shrine;The Sumiyoshi Taisha shrine is the main shrine for all of the Sumiyoshi shrines around Japan. The various buildings of the shrine are spread out around a park-like area, featuring traditional Japanese architecture and landscaping at its purest. You really want to slow down when you enter the area, remembering that this is not just some historical sight, but also a part of a living, breathing religion. With the correct attitude, you can really take in the feel of this place and appreciate the thought that has gone into it. This was my first major shrine in Japan, and it definitely left an impression. Beautiful.
16;Visiting;Omg !!! Amazing and breathtaking . . It is worth all of your time and it’s free to enter . 😛. The grounds are so clean and well keep . . It’s very relaxing and you see all the children in their kimonos . The temple is incredible . So beautiful . . It’s a wonderful insight to Japanese culture and traditions . 🥰. Especially , if you go on the weekend!
16;WEDDING CEREMONY;First time I saw and fortunated to witness Japan Traditional wedding ceremony in this temple . The red Soribashi arch bridge is a link between outside area and inside of the temple. This arch bridge become one of the best photo spot in Kansai. There are several places in Sumiyoshi Taisha. The temple building is different from the other temples in Japan,the roof is triangular in shape or called Sumiyoshi Zukuri like the roof in Shirakawago. The close station is Sumiyoshi Taisa Station on the Nankai Line and use Hankai tram line stop at Sumiyoshitoriimae Station and just walking a few meters.
16;Beautiful Bridge, Nice Surrounding Grounds;I visited the Sumiyoshi Taisha Shrine On June 11th with my two adult sons and my daughter-in-law and I really enjoyed viewing buildings with a different arechitectural design. The structures at this shrine were siad to be built prior to influence from China, and one could see a distinct difference in the shapes of the roof and the ornate fascias. The red bridge was really cool, although a bit hard to walk over without holding on to the guardrail. We walked around the extensive grounds but missed the Cat Shrine. I was trying to find that since my daughter-in-law likes cats. Since it was a very warm day, there were only a few others walking about. We stayed in the shaded areas, did some sight seeing and I collected a goshuin from the Shrine.
17;Simple Japanese Wedding with Shinto Priest;Pros : - Simple Shinto wedding ceremony can be arranged. English speaking, No big fanfare, the basics are there with Shinto rituals, photos and cert - Renew marriage vows - To get blessings for love - To get blessings for baby (born and unborn) - Fox trinket is really cute - Many other trinkets for many sorts of blessing - Very few visitors, thus fast efficient effective and no people in the photo background (photo bomb) - Very serene. Note - They speak sufficient English. To have the Shinto wedding ceremony, please contact the temple first. We visited the temple first, discussed with the Chief Abbot on the process/ procedure, and came back 4 days later for the ceremony. Man to to be in a respectable suit, woman to dress in long dress and simple jacket (to cover cleavage if any/ look more formal). No sexy outfits please. Ceremony took  around 20 mins. Stayed back to take photos and all done within an hour. Can't remember the fee, but it was very affordable. - Went to a few other temples to enquire. The price was 10x more, waiting time much longer, ceremony needs to involve renting of hall, fandb, etc.. Very complicated. Thus this Tamatsukuri Inari Shrine is the best of them all for a tourist like me.
17;#10 of the Osaka 33 Kannon Pilgrimage;The #10 deity of the Osaka 33 Kannon Pilgrimage used to be enshrined in Tamatsukuri Inari Shrine before the Gods and Buddhas Separation Order by the Meiji Restoration Government in 1868.  I crossed Nagahori-dori Street to the north and climbed a hill to get to the shrine.  In the middle of the hill, I found a tree standing in the middle of the street.  It must be a holy tree.  Believe it or not, Tamatsukuri Inari Shrine was said to have been founded in 12 B.C   It was revived in the 6th century.
17;Japanese Temple;It is located in Morinamiya. Quite nice place. I visited this place while small festival. I can recommend it to you and your family.
18;Shinto shrine in Osaka;Osaka Tenmangu is a Shinto shrine located in the Kita ward of Osaka. It is one of the most popular shrines in Osaka and the site of Japan's biggest festivals, Tenjin Matsuri which features a lively procession of floats and attracts thousands of spectators. . The shrine's main hall, called Honden, is a beautiful structure with intricate carvings and decorations and is the point of prayers. The shrine also has a large collection of Ema, small wooden plaques where visitors can write their wishes and prayers. These plaques can be bought at the outlet in the premises along with other blessed artefacts. . Overall, Osaka Tenmangu is a must-visit attraction for anyone interested in Japanese culture and history. Its beautiful architecture, serene gardens, and cultural significance make it a unique and memorable destination in Osaka. It's free to visit and is open from early till 5pm everyday.
18;Interesting Place;Located near Tenjinbashi-suji shopping street, this place is very quiet but beautiful, A worth place to visit after you shopped around Tenjinbashi-suji shopping street. The closest station to Tenmangu Shrine is Minamimorimachi Station on the Tanimachi and Sakaisuji Subway Lines and Osaka Temmangu Station on the JR Tozai Line
18;Small But Interesting Shrine;I was staying in a hotel not far from Osaka Tenmangu Shrine and had a couple hours in the afternoon to explore the area and neighborhood so I visited the shrine. Osaka Tenmangu Shrine, founded in the 10th century, is one of the most important of hundreds of shrines across Japan that are devoted to the Shinto deity of scholarship, Sugawara Michizane. Osaka Tenmangu Shrine has been destroyed by fire a number of times during its history, and its current main hall (honden) and main gate date back to 1845. The shrine is nestled in a residential area and has fewer visitors than the more popular known temples and shrines. It was nice to spend the time wandering around the complex which houses a few other smaller structures. If you are in the neighborhood and have not yet done the "temple tour" or tired out from visiting all the temples, make a short visit to Osaka Tenmangu Shrine and the surrounding neighborhood.
18;Nice quite hidden temple;This is a very quiet hidden temple. Smaller in size than you’d expect but very nice stop. If you are in the area it’s definitely worth the stop.
18;Quiet place;A quiet place despite in the busy city of Osaka. A good place for photo taking as there is a lot of sculptures
18;Great Shrine;One of the three biggest festivals in Japan, Tenjin Festival's organizer . God of academics, to serve Sugawara Michizane. It is crowded with people who pray to God to pass university and high school entrance examination. From the fact that Sugawara Mamo loved plums, the emblem of the shrine is a plum design.
18;God for study;There are many Tenmangu in Japan, and here in Osaka there is also one. This shrine is also famous for Tenjin Matsuri festival, which takes place at the end of July every year. Compared with Tenmangu of Kyoto or that of Dazaifu, this shrine is not big. However thanks to its location, the premises are always crowded with the visitors. The subway station Minami Morimachi or JR Osaka Tenmangu is the nearest station.
18;Beautiful little shrine;Beautiful little shrine. Very popular for a New Year's visit although suffered an extensive damage during the earthquake. Be sure to rub the Ox's head for greater intelligence!
18;Peaceful;We visited this shrine today and found it really peaceful. It was a 3 minute walk from Temmangu station so very easy to get to. We were approached by a monk who gave each of us a trinket and asked for 5,000 yen. We didn't have that much on us so he dropped his price to 2,000 yen. I felt like I was in Bali...
18;Hosting one of the 3 great festivals in Osaka - Tenjin Matsuri;Every July, the Tenjin Matsuri is held here. This is Osaka's most fabulous festival, where you can view gorgeous fireworks.
18;Ordinary Shrine near Tenjinbashisuji Shopping Arcade;We went to the shrine as we are walking along tenjinbashisuji shopping arcade, the shrine is pretty ordinary, nothing much to see and will only take 5 minutes. Perhaps the place would be more interesting if there is an event. No harm dropping by if you are in the area, but not worth to make a trip only to pay a visit.
18;Worth it;One of the only temples in Osaka that have been kept up since before WWII. It is located in one of the most nice shopping streets of all Japan. best visiting it in the morning when opens or at night when closing. If you can also take the tour and try the sacred sake it will be worth:)
19;Iconic Glico sign;A must in Osaka, lot of restaurants around too. Walk along the canal, and the Namba Yasaka Shrine is pretty close (walking distance).
19;Colourful and atmospheric;Came here for lunch during our one day visit to Osaka. Our taxi driver had boasted the merits of Osaka’s okonomiyaki, so we decided to try it out. Good, but for us,  Hiroshima, where they include bean sprouts, still tops the list. Busy and decorated in colourful signage the district is well worth a visit. There is a wide range of food available. One shop, selling takoyaki, (battered octopus balls) had a picture of British prime minister Boris Johnson demonstrating his cooking skills.
19;Visually impressive both day and night;Osaka's vibrant entertainment area with an abundance of restaurants and neon signs including the famous Glico Man sign. During the day we found the streets packed but manageable. At night the place is even more impressive and a must area to visit when in Osaka.
19;Add to your to do list!;Our visit to Osaka was too short and there an abundance of areas to explore. 2 days minimum to truly immerse yourself in awesome Japanese culture! Foodie world! Tons of fun and not to be missed!
19;Street food heaven;Dotonbori is Osaka's entertainment district located close to Shinsaibashi-Suji Shopping Street. It's popular for its vibrant nightlife, delicious street food, and iconic neon signage, it's a must-visit destination if you're in the area. The area is full of restaurants, bars, and shops, including high-end designer stores and traditional Japanese souvenir shops. We visited for dinner today and was spoilt for choice due to the number of restaurants and specialist dishes on offer on top of street food like Takoyaki. Overall, Dotonbori is a lively neighborhood that is a must visit in Osaka.
19;Crazy in a good way;We spent our last night in Japan in Osaka so got to sample the delights of Dotombori. It is a real attack on the senses bright lights, noise and smells but so good to go and see. There's a bit of everything for everyone here but the opening times can be a bit crazy!
19;The place to go in Osaka;Food and people everywhere. Be ready to line up for most popular places. Obviously you'll have to wait longer whenever it's lunch or dinner time.
19;Lots of Fun;This is a very lively area.  Go in the evening when the neon lights are bright.  You should get some very good pictures.  Shopping, restaurants, bars.  Just a fun area!
19;Busy and busy;We came here 3 times by taking a train from our hotel. Tons of local street foods and shopping halls and it is more colorful  at night Recommend
19;Street Food Across The Bridge From Shinsaibashi;The Dotombori District is just across the bridge from the Shinsaibashi Shopping Arcade. Where in Shinsaibashi the emphasis is on the shopping, Dotombori's emphasis is on the food specifically street food. Though there are restaurants here, most are foodstalls where you buy the food and eat it as you walk somewhere else. It has a lively atmosphere though if your reason for visiting it is to eat, avoid coming here during a rainy day. We came on a rainy day and basically used the lobby of a small building as a place to shelter and eat otherwise our food would've been rained on.
19;SO…MANY…BARS!;Pick a building, go to the top and find a bar. Then do the same again. For hours. It is so much fun and there is seemingly infinite variety. Come for for a GREAT night out…
19;The pulsing centre of Osaka.;Lights, crowds, action!  A great way to see Osaka is to walk along the pathway by the stream.  Lots of interesting characters.  I hope you like knee-high boots.
19;Good place to visit in Osaka;One of the best places in Osaka for food trip. Has a lot of good restaurants everywhere. A bit crowded but you will surely find a good restaurant here.
19;Good for spend time and money;If you are traveling with family or alone you can do shopping here and also this is Osaka’s iconic place so you can enjoy the view during the day and night. It’s always very crowded so please take that into consideration. It’s worth visiting this place
19;Best Kuliner Osaka;Dotombori is very nice place for hanging out, food, drink all very nice here, lokal food like takoyaki, Ichiran is the best, love it
20;A must;This area is a must if you are in Osaka. There are plenty of things to do!! Especially eating delicious food.
20;family trip march 2023;Prime location with tons of Fandb and entertainment. Along the streets have quite alot of clubbing pubs which may not be suitable for young teens,
20;Interesting neighbourhood…;…to explore, especially the narrower backstreets. Loads of different restaurants to find plus the big shopping centres and shrines everyone knows already.
20;QUALITY FOOD;Food: Good quality food. Service: Always had great service Value: Pricey but worth it Ambiance: Nice Teppanyaki dining with shared seating Reservations: Highly recommended. Have been to Minami several times. Nice and upscale environment, with a serene garden background/backdrop at most of the Teppanyaki tables. Slight seasonal variations in regards to the appetizers/salads, decent selection of wines to pair with the meal courses. Fixed menu courses with slight variations/substitutions allowed to accommodate allergies or personal preferences.  All of the course items are generally well though out and well balanced. Reservations are recommended given the limited seating availability.  Be prepared to spend between $100.00-$200.00+USD per person depending on the course selected.
20;Fantastic place;This by far the most beautiful place to spend time in Osaka. It is full of shopping stores and restaurants and it's very nice during nightime.
20;Very alive at night;Definitely worth a visit at night with the neon colourful lights.  Plenty of people everywhere creates a great atmosphere.  So many places to eat ranging across all budgets.  Shops galore.  Great for people watching.  Enjoyed our stroll through and the quick style meal that we settled for.  Easy to get to via subway or train.
20;You would find everything you want to find these area in Osaka.;Visiting this area, you would find many shopping stores , many restaurants and even duty free stores. This place is very easy access from anywhere in Osaka. So when you stay anywhere in Osaka, Hotel, very easy to go by subway and car.
20;Flashy lights and loads of street food;This is a great place to visit to see the lights flashy restaurant signs and try so local street food .. my favourite part was trying all the different types of foods on offer ..
20;Fun to walk through!;We walked through this area and it is nice by the water, Fun place for a stroll and to shop. It is nice at night when it is lit up. Plenty to see and places to eat. The whole shopping experience in Osaka is fun.
20;Don Quijote;I like the vibe especially at night time. You can also see here the famous Don Quijote where you can shop all your favorite Japanese products
21;Must visit;Shinsaibashi-Suji Shopping Street is a bustling and vibrant shopping district located in the city. Spanning over 600 meters, this street is home to shops, restaurants, and cafes that cater to a wide range of tastes and preferences. We found everything from high-end fashion boutiques to affordable souvenir shops, as well as traditional Japanese goods and street food. The atmosphere is lively and energetic, making it a popular destination for both locals and tourists. Whether you're looking to shop, eat, or simply soak up the lively atmosphere, Shinsaibashi-Suji Shopping Street is definitely worth a visit.
21;Arcade shopping;If you are going to be in Dotonbori you can't miss this place. Nice place to window shopping and protect yourself from the elements. You can easily spend hours here shopping and eating.
21;Cheap Shopping;The best place to shop in Osaka where you are looking for basic souvenirs to cosmetics, this is the place to be! Every night, I droppes by the place from  the activity to buy stuff. There were also street foods! It was raining during the visit, but still fun since the shopping street was covered (except when crossing to the other side.)
21;The Place To Be In Osaka;If you are a regular traveler, you will inevitably gravitate here to see what the hype is all about. If you are someone who is after the shopping, you will find yourselves walking up and down this long shopping arcade multiple times during your time in Osaka. There are shops, restaurants, and even shopping centers along this stretch of road. Accessible to public transport through the Shinsaibashi Osaka Metro Station. Other than early morning, it does get very crowded.
21;Fun shopping streets;Fun street, lots of shops only had a short time to visit but it was good nonethelss,  lots of seafood if your into it
21;For the Shoppers amongst you ........ For Me - My idea of Hell;Seething Mass of Humanity (SMOH) seeking the Holy Grail. To me - a jabbering throng of bodies, thrown together in a hot, steamy, sweaty, smelly, crowded tunnel between lines of shops, without a care for anybody or anything, and certainly no sense of personal space. Lived in Asia for years, but never encountered such scenes. Being unable to read Japanese, made it more stark, as we were completely reliant on our senses of sight, sound, and smell. Sometimes even, our imagination was called into play, and not always that helpfully. It is an experience but not for the Unwarry
21;Shop till you Drop;Close to Dotonbori, this shopping street is everything the shopaholic needs. There are also many restaurants and chic cafes for you to rest for a while after strolling down the street. A good place to shop, but be careful as this place tends to be over packed with people.
21;Must go when you are in Osaka;Shinsaibashi is the main shopping area in Osaka.  Lots and lots of shops and restaurants.  And even more tourists crowding the area.  Still, one must visit Shinsaibashi when in Osaka even if it's just to absorb the energy and vibe of the city.  Go at night for the dazzling night view with all the neon signs.  There's bound to be something, whether shopping or eating, for everyone.
21;A Shopping Street it certainly is;This shopping street goes on for miles with all sorts of wares on offer,from labels to cafes,to drug stores aplenty. Everything doesn't open until 11 am and closes late. Be prepared for Kamakazi bike riders criss crossing the strip and also heaps and heaps of people.Be mindful of the their traffic lights as they are above a lot of walkways and you have to have your wits about you.If you get caught Jay walking you will be booked!!!
21;Central Place for hopping in Osaka;This is a nearby place to dotonbri where one can go for shopping of any things. But majority of the things are imported from China. The local products are also worth trying
22;Fun in the evenings;Shinsekai is considered a seedy, even dangerous part of Osaka, by the Japanese that is. It used to be grimy and crimy back in the day, but really, these days it is just a somewhat retro part of the city with good eats that borders on some suspect neighborhoods and has some (unusually visible for Japan) prostitution around the edges. It is a bit uninteresting during the days, but in the evenings, you'll find people partying it up, and all of the lights look great in the dark. As said, there's also a lot of good eating to be had, with kushikatsu being well represented. (There are also alcohol dispensing vending machines in the area, for the budget-minded.) If you want even more views, the Tsutenkaku tower has a viewing deck for some great ones. As for security, you are pretty much good unless you wander south past the railroad tracks, where most of the city's homeless live. They are mostly old men though, and not particularly dangerous as such, but it isn't a good scene for the casual tourist. You will see some of these geriatric alcoholics wandering around Shinsekai as well, and sleeping rough in the alleys, but in general, if you don't bother them, they don't bother you, doing their best to be invisible. Shinsekai is an iconic, must-see part of Osaka, but if it gets a bit much for you, wander east into the park, past the Zoo gates, for some air.
23;A Time Travel Adventure in Osaka;A haven of Japanese and Global Anime Culture spanning from toys, fashion, gadgets, videos, etc. Never can one imagine a place that has everything where you can be in different timelines in one place. All collectibles from 60's,70's until now can be found in this place. Every character that existed took their inspiration from everythig you find here. Transformers toys originated from Diaclone, even the Power Ranger Franchise, etc. The place also features a big number of second hand electronics store with high quality refurbished goods from iphone, android, laptops, etc. The place is for all ages even for adult collectors. You can also experience a maid's cafe getaway or explore the cosplay shopping and culture yourself. A paradise for geeks and if you not a geek, this place can make you one.;
23;Perfect for otakus and geeks;This was one of my go to places to go for games and goodies shopping. You can find stores selling everything, ranging from new items on preorders to second hand goods. Stores usually have their specificities, like cards, toys, figures, anime/ manga etc. There's a few places you can go to have a proper weeb experience, like the maid cafes lol Overall a very nice place to go shopping, and there's a cosplay festival as well!;
23;Great shopping, unique arcades!;It's a must see for any otaku or anime lover. The prices of second hand figures here are much better than Tokyo. You can find good quality figures of current anime series for usually 600-1000yen cheaper than the same items in Tokyo. There's also a decent amount of retro game stores here and around Osaka which again, tend to be cheaper than the retro stores in Tokyo. Don't only stay on the main street, check the sides and surrounding streets for small shops and arcades. The arcades have really unique game machines that have been manually adjusted by the owners to make a whole new experience. I'm especially fond of the ping pong ball machine games, you use a claw machine mechanism to scoop up ping pong balls and attempt to drop one into the highlighted hole on half of a Takoyaki grill.;
23;Maybe few;Interesting shops, but the rest are a waste of time. Much in quantity, not in variety or quality. Tokyo is better;
23;What Is the Fuss Above?;Saw only run down old shops selling dated electronic goods, cheap plastic toys and housewares, and adult DVD shops. Nothing like Tokyo’s Akihabara and Harajuku district.;
23;To summarize: Anime-land.;If you're a die hard anime fan of any kind, this is the place for you hands down. Generally it has all the anime anyone likes i.e Gundam, One Piece, Naruto, Fate etc.. the list can go on and on. The shops have excessive amount of figurines, models, t-shirts, manga and quirky items for you to browse. Some stores provide mainstream items (not anime related) like Marvel, DC, Transformers, Ultraman, Tamiya trains, Tomica cars etc. There are also cafes, restaurants, arcade centers, electronics appliances and 18+ shops if you're wondering what else besides anime. We spent a fair amount of time here, I'd say 3-4 hours max (including an hour spent in a cafe) is all you need for this place, more if you're a super fan.;
23;Good, but a few issues;Like some previous reviewers have mentioned this is NOT Akihabara and the differences annoyed my teenage son: Different manga, anime, videogame, etc. stores are scattered around (not close by like in Akihabara) and there is a lot of walking involved. For serious visitors I would recommend doing your homework. I thought I did mine and had some surprises and even had to use Google maps to find the Mandarake store. This was a sample of my poor itinerary: Taito Game station -> Gee store -> yellow submarine -> dragon star (cards) -> Sofmap Namba -> Torejaras -> Super potato -> Animate -> Mandarake And obviously visiting the Dragon quest’s themed Lawson store. Some surprises: 1) Some stores open at noon (we arrived early and had to wait). 2) There are two Super Potato stores (as well as two yellow submarines, but those are located closer to each other). At Super Potato I was expecting themed t-shirts (like in Akihabara), but didn’t find any. 3) Again, the store’s physical distribution. I reiterate because I planned for a one day visit and poor preparation on my part made me return to Denden town the next day. So, depending on your fan level and schedule visiting other Osaka tourist attractions I would suggest planning accordingly.;
23;Cool area, even if anime isn’t you thing;Cool area with lots of shops catering for anime, manga, gaming etc. Even if those aren’t your thing, it’s interesting for people watching and seeing the insane variety of goods on sale. It’s actually difficult to find the correct streets so google Animate Osaka Nippombashi and the street that shop is on is the centre of it all. There are also several cool old alleyways in between that street and the next street to the east, which are packed full of tiny stores and are worth investigating.;
23;Old town;It feels like old downtown Osaka. A long street with many shops for electronics and home stuff. There was also some shops for textiles and other things. A few restaurants in the area here and there. The shops close a bit early though, maybe by sunset many of the shops close.;
23;Toy shopping;If you are looking for One piece, Dragon Z figures this is place to go! There are three stores that rent acrylic cubes for people to sell there stuff in. Hundreds of cubes to view! Unfortunately since I am into more Kikaida and Kamen Rider stuff so the two stores to visit is Jungle and Hero Gangu. Prices have doubled since last year so happy that I bought items years before.;
23;Anime;Really nice place if your looking to buy figures DVDs or any anime stuff. Lots of choices and cheap prices. You can also find various electronic stores where you can buy almost anything. Highly recommend if your a geek.;
24;Good Variety of food along the little narrow streets;Good variety of food along the little narrow streets.  A mixture of western and asian food in interesting little shops, some can be a bit quirky.  Recommend for a short visit if in the area;
24;Weird and Strange - reminded me of New Orleans;We visited here as missionaries, which was great and badly needed. Lot's of foot traffic and little shops. Kind of a creepy atmosphere almost. Not dangerous but just not necessarily a good place for children. Critter's Burgers was awesome but most of the shops are weird and overpriced. I might visit again as a missionary or something but I would not call this an attraction for families either. I would say go see it, but do not have a huge expectation of amazement or anything. Parking was a little hard to find and just a note on that you park, and then once your time expired the boot goes up and you pay to have that lowered when you leave. Bring 1000 yen notes. Parking was not expensive.;
24;Don’t bother;This place is the only place in Japan i have not felt safe. Whilst i have never been to America, I imagine this is what it would feel like walking around the ghetto. This place is filled with Chinese and Koreans and really has nothing to do with Japan or its culture. Yes there were older teens and young adults hanging out but I would not recommend this place as a ‘must do’ in Osaka;
24;Unique finds;Vintage items to great foods. You can find variety of selection here at American Mura. One of our favorite places to visit in Osaka. Shop, Eat, People watch!!!;
24;Chill place;Lots of shops, for sports wear / surf / skate visit Spotaka. They have an indoor skate park as well. America Mura is just across the road from Shinsaibashi.;
24;More Harlem than Manhattan;The name of this area can be quite misleading. Amerikamura, or American village, is indeed an extension of Dotombori full of budget hotels and restaurants catering to tourists. Yes, there are fashion boutiques but definitely not the vibe foreigners expect. It is also the only place in Japan with a sketchy atmosphere.;
24;US style;Very 'american' and young area. You could 'feel' the american energy and US army. Many vintage clothes stores and some cute coffee/snack shops. Nice walk under sunshine. Not a must to go but if you would like to feel some US in osaka, worth a visit;
24;Really Cool retro fashion and paraphernalia;This is a really cool retro fashion area. There is some really awesome shops and paraphernalia. It's a must visit if you're interested in clothing that is a bit different.;
24;Ok;I found it to be just another area like Dotombori.  I wouldn’t have gone out of my way to come here. There are lots of fashion outlets that sell more urban clothes.;
24;Cool;It is the place that most of the youngsters hang, it has a very cool vibe and on Sundays it is full of lots of interesting characters from all walks of life. Try to go to the toilets in the big shopping mall, they look like something out of Star trek.;
25;Dragon Ball GET;Entered the store at 17:00 at the reservation time. A male clerk (store owner) welcomes you and guides you. Register the Osaka prefecture's corona tracking system exactly. First of all, there is a confirmation that the order is for the course, and if you tell it that it is not a course, you will be told that you will be charged. I understand! Let's enjoy Japanese sake
25;Cospa normal;I was taken to a restaurant where it was difficult to make a reservation. About an 8 minute walk from Juso Station. If you ask whether the cost performance of the locality is good, it will be 6-7000 yen per person. It's topical, but I have the impression that one time is enough.
25;not a food stall;Get off at the west exit of Juso Station, walk all the way through the shopping street and turn left, and you will find Juso Sushi Stalls. The ingredients are fresh and very delicious. Wouldn't it be double if you eat in Shinchi? There is also original creative sushi and it is very good. It is a shop that I want to revisit.
25;Creative sushi restaurant with bad cost performance;First visit after moving, last time was a vinyl stall store about 7 years ago. Among the four staff members, the middle-aged and older staff members were the same, and the two young staff members were seeing it for the first time. There are two things that have not changed: (1) You can still enjoy delicious creative sushi. (2) The bill remains high without change. So, as a supplementary explanation about ②, we ordered 4 alcoholic drinks and delicious a la carte sushi for 2 people, about 13,500 yen for 2 people. I think it's cheaper than Kitashinchi, but it's expensive if it's Juso price. That's why I'm subtracting one star. Perhaps thanks to the Internet society, there were many young couples, but they completed the checkout in less time than we did. Change came for 2 people 10,000 yen. If you are a drinker or stay long, it is a sushi restaurant for 10,000 yen per person. I eat out a lot, but once I visit, it's always a place I won't go to for the time being. I was worried that it might fall off. If you go anyway, be prepared to budget up to 20,000 yen for two people.
25;I want my customers to be taken care of;The shop is located under the Juso Bypass. There are also unusual ingredients, so you can eat delicious seasonal sushi. It's a system that you can't make a reservation without registering your phone number, but one day, because you didn't receive an email, your phone registration was deleted and you couldn't make a reservation. Recently, it is common to change email addresses, and I cannot deny the feeling of being betrayed by a store that I would have visited dozens of times without noticing that I had to contact the store. became.
25;Famous;A sushi restaurant in Juso. It is a small shop with a counter. Creative sushi is also popular. I am also happy with the polite customer service. Is delicious.
25;Many local customers;In the past, it was a sushi restaurant with a vinyl sheet that looked like a food stall. It is a restaurant with a reputation because it is delicious and the customer service is solid. Refurbished and clean. This shop is also loved by locals.
25;Sushi to taste and eat one by one;It's a very small shop. About 10 people. They hold it according to the speed of eating slowly one by one. One by one with the words, "This is salt, please, this is sudachi, this is nothing." It was a very fun restaurant with avocado and eel sushi.
25;creative sushi restaurant with bad cost performance;There are a few old men who make sushi, but they make fancy creative sushi. Most of the toppings are prepared with a little effort, so you can enjoy them all. Big fresh stuff! For those who want to enjoy many kinds of food rather than those who want to eat. I think the price is reasonable. Of course, if you eat a lot, you'll be fascinated, but.. It's thirteen, so it's better to eat lightly and go to the second one.
25;Hideaway under the elevated road;It has been a few years since this shop, which started with the feel of a food stall, became prosperous and moved to a new store next door. From rare material to classics, I work hard. The staff and the reservation system are a bit quirky, so I think it's a matter of compatibility.
26;Small shopping mall with great restaurants;Directly connected to kyobashi station, and has many great place to eat including ramen, udon, beef and coffee.
26;Welcome & good bye by machine;
26;So convenient when travelling by rail;
26;Somewhat good location but small and dated.;
26;Great stay , made a vist to Osaka very easy;
26;Convenient but small;
26;First time travelers to Japan and we stayed at 7 hotels/cities and this was probably my least favorite.;
26;Great location, very accessible;
26;Great economical choice.;
26;Best location for tourists;
27;live;Like a live performance, like an event, like a stage. I went for Just entertainment! It was a really fun time. Drinks used to be 500 yen, but now they are 600 yen. The original drink holder is cute.
27;Downtown is also a live house;For the first time, I went to a summer festival live from another prefecture. The facilities are perfect, but the gap with the surroundings was interesting. Since it was a weekday, there were few people on the street.  The arena standing on the 1st floor is exciting, but this time I want to enjoy the 2nd floor as well.
27;neither too close nor too far.;Although it is a little far from Namba Station, it is within walking distance. The stage was neither near nor far, and even my poor eyesight could see the artists very well. It feels just right as if the width was really just right. I think you can participate when your favorite artist uses this place.

28;quiet and comfortable place;There is a small port behind Universal Studios, and a boat sails past Li from the Aquarium on the opposite bank. There is a nice large stepped seat here, which can sit up and wait for the boat better than many people, blowing the sea breeze, enjoying the scenery on the other side, and even taking a rest is a very comfortable thing.
28;no place to wait;The street in front was narrow, so the merchandise was sold inside, but general goods, member goods, CDs, and the lottery were all lined up in the same line before being separated. So there are people complaining that they have to wait in line even though the CD and lottery are empty. It took quite a while because there weren't many accounting staff. There is no cafe in the hotel next door, so the nearest hotel is Universal Port on the USJ side. There was a table seat at the end of Lawson, but it was quite cold because it was along the river and there was a wind. A new hotel was under construction in front of the station.
28;You can also see the second floor well.;3rd time here and first time. I was on the second floor. It was the front of the second floor, so I was able to see it slowly. Is it prohibited to lean against the fence? It seems that The chairs are comfortable and there are drink holders. I got a drink first and used it. There is also a toilet on the second floor, so only those with reserved seats can use it. It was vacant. Since there was a seat this time, I also used my luggage at the seat. I also participated in the floor below.
28;Enjoy Live!;I think the best way to enjoy a live performance is to go empty-handed. For that reason, the presence or absence of coin lockers is important. It may depend on the organizer, but it was difficult to find the entrance to the coin locker outside. The row of toilets and the row of coin lockers were complicated on the way. I thought the instructions would be easier to understand. There were many coin lockers inside! At the live, I was in the second or third row from the front. I felt so close to the artist! When approaching the audience, It felt like I was looking at the artist's face from below!
28;New Zepp;New Zepp. There is nothing around, only 7-Eleven. The train arrived from JR Osaka Station in about 15 minutes, and it was actually closer than I thought. It's a big live house, but there's a fence on the way, so I was able to lean against it and watch it. There were many toilets and they were clean.
28;new feeling.;A very beautiful Zepp It seems that it was built in 2017, and it is about a 7-minute walk from JR Sakurajima Station to Nishikujo along the tracks. A convenient and clean venue. There's nothing. Since there is only about 7-Eleven, it seems that it is quite painful to wait for a long time outside the venue.
28;nothing around.;First visit for an event. Good location, just a few minutes walk from JR Sakurajima Station. I checked in advance, but there is nothing around, so there is no place to kill time until the event.. There is only a 7-Eleven.. The inside is a normal large live house. There was a locker inside, too. I didn't know, so I left it outside before entering. (By the way, there was a temporary locker next to Sakurajima Station.) It would have been nice if it was sunny on the day, but what happened to sales on rainy days? I wonder if it's inside.. Also, it's a new facility, but the toilet is not a washlet.. Also, there is no shielding, so it's fine when it's warm, but the day I went there was a big difference in temperature, and it was very cold after the evening.
29;Interesting experience though not necessary a tourist spot;There are few reviews of this place as it rightly should be for a red-light district. Was made curious about this place when I heard from my Japanese colleague that there was a “display” sort of red-light district in Osaka, which is probably the only one of its kind in the world. Hence, decided to check out this area for the vibes, since I was at nearby Namba station. It was interesting to walk along the 5 major rows of shophouses, taking curious glances into the various shops and with the elderly woman beckoning to you from within the house. There must be around 100 such houses opened for business, with the first three streets, being the ones with the pretty ladies. Some were cute, some were hot, and some dressed in uniforms. Towards the fourth and fifth street there were all other sorts of ladies, plus size, mature, etc. I don’t speak the language and didn’t visit any of the “restaurant”, so can’t comment on anything, other than the fact that it didn’t feel scared or dangerous walking along the street. Most people walking the streets are Japanese man between the age of 20-40 years old and often in small groups. There were some tourists like myself walking the streets and soaking up the atmosphere. Definitely an experience on its own, and yup, please be respectful and no pictures allowed (even on the streets).
29;Very good;There are still many such opportunities overseas, but there are fewer such cases in Japan. I want you to leave it forever.

29;foreign land. One of the five major Shinchi in Osaka, it is by far the best in terms of scale and name recognition. It's a former red-light district, so it has a nice atmosphere. Even if I write something beautiful, it's okay, so grab 15,000 yen and let's go!
29;Poche recensioni;I don't know if it's ashamed and that's why there are so few reviews. However it is an experience that must be done, in the sense of having to walk these streets. I didn't spend a thousand thousand yen on an experience that I already know would be disappointing, but to walk around and be called back by these old women, or to be greeted by the gorgeous girls (some meow), or to be smirked at because gajin, is worth it absolutely worth it. Ah, everything closes at midnight, even the metro and then like me you have to walk to Namba.
29;Atmosphere that can only be found here in Japan;It is a place where you can feel a very interesting atmosphere as if you had slipped back in time to the Edo period. I think it's worth seeing once as an adult social studies tour. Do not go with women or children.
29;another world;It's interesting just to look at it. The lady who calls you is interesting, and the cosplay of the sisters is also good.
29;Former red-light district, current restaurant;She falls in love with a waitress on the second floor of a Japanese restaurant. That's what it is. The amount paid to the restaurant is the same for all restaurants. Some shops open in the early afternoon, so women generally shouldn't go to this area. Peeping into the restaurant out of curiosity is strictly prohibited. If you're going to visit the historic Taiyoshi Hyakuban, it's a good idea to check the route in advance. “Taiyoshi Hyakuban” is located on the outskirts of the restaurant group. If you just want to see the exterior and atmosphere of Tobita Shinchi, let's finish in the morning. Also, there seems to be a festival in the summer, so that might be a good timing. I can't recommend bantering, and I think it would be nice to drive down the street and see it. It is strictly forbidden to take pictures near the restaurant or the restaurant itself. After falling in love with a man, he can get a licking candy, so if you carry it while walking down the street, the restaurant won't talk to you. There are many parking lots nearby. Public toilets are also available in the district.
29;A street where you can feel the old days;This is an adult-oriented place. It's a place where you can feel the atmosphere of the past in the modern age, but it's for adults, so it's better not to bring children.
