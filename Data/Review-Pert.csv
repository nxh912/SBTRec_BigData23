1;What a wonderful venue;Jordan and the team made hosting our Sangeet night at the Perth Town Hall a wonderful experience!! What a wonderful venue, brand new floors, state of the art lighting and full of history, I would highly recommend you consider the Perth Town Hall for your next function. Thank you!
1;Renovated Town Hall clock still chimes the hours;The scaffolding is down on the Perth Town Hall after months of restoration. The Town Hall clock performed an important function in days gone by, keeping time when few people could afford watches. Indeed, it was not unusual for different cities to work to different times. The clock face now has the lustrous colors in had in the 1870s and the tower has been restored The Ennis family has maintained the Town Hall Clock for almost 100 years. I can remember going into the Ennis's jewelry shop with my mother when I was in primacy school, which is a long time ago now.
1;Symbol of pride for the people of Perth;For many years, Perth Town Hall was the most prominent civic building in the city. The Town Hall is built of red brick in Gothic style, with embellishments such as the broad arrows indicating that it was built by convict labour. In recent years, the people of Perth have taken renewed pride in this historic building. The ugly grey panels at the base of the Town Hall have been replaced with red brick that matches the original masonry, and the Hall has been renovated. Once more, the Town Hall is a symbol of pride for the people Perth.
1;The place where my parents met!;Although the building is nothing special, the area that's surrounding it is magical to me. Seeing how an area changes and urbanises throughout the years is truly something special that can only be witnessed with time. For anyone going for a walk around the area, take time and pay attention to some of the finer details that's incorporated in the architecture of the Town Hall
1;Historic Elegance;Beautiful building dating to 1869 and the only Town Hall in Australia built in the Gothic style and built by convicts. I last visited in the 1980/90's for philatelic exhibitions and collector fairs. Since then the building has undergone extensive renovation and restoration, completed in 2005, and which returned the building to its former charm and elegance. Wonderful to have the opportunity to revisit and view the interior restorations and the artefacts displayed on the upper floor. The massive support columns add an aura of permanence. Great informative plaques are affixed to the exterior walls. This grand building is set to charm many future generations
1;Heritage & History;Perth Town Hall really stands out regardless which direction your approaching from within Perth City. A small park area opposite & relax and patiently wait for the Clock to Chime. Unfortunately I didn't have time to go inside
1;Australiia's only town hall built by convicts;The Perth Town Hall was bulit in 1870, by convicts. If you look carefully you can see the broad arrows left by the convict builders, the mark of shame they carried on their backs. The Town Hall is built in Gothic Revival style, made with red Western Australian bricks. For many years, there was a horrible grey base disfiguring to the Town Hall now it's been upgraded to the original structure. In addition, the Town Hall has been modernised to host weddings, parties -- anything! In years gone by, the Wildlife Show at the Town Hall was the height of a naturalist's year. Perth may be a much bigger, more proserpous city the Town Hall is a reminder of things past.
1;Attractive Building;We noticed this handsome building on our walk about tour of the city. It looks good and impressive. Nice part of town.
2;Excellent 2pm Friday tour of Parliament House;Attended the excellent 2pm Friday tour of Parliament House, which was informative, fascinating and brought alive by our excellent guide Tina from the Parliamentary Education Office . She went above and beyond the usual tour guide remit to bring us anecdotes and history of the building, its practices and stories of the surrounding area and also how the parliamentary process works from the floor of the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly chambers. We saw the dining arrangements and administrative offices, discussed the similarities and differences between our own British House of Commons and House of Lords, and concluded the tour with some free momentos of the day. It was a relaxed, informative and entertaining visist, which I would recommend to anyone that is keen to learn more about the Western Australian parliament and its history. There is also a very reasonably priced souvenir store.
2;Heritage building few will ever see;Parliament House is one of Perth's most impressive buildings, but few will ever see inside. The external structure, which is built of pinkish sandstone, can be seen on the hill at the end of St George's Terrace. It's hard to miss. The innterior can seen on a tour, The Legislative Assembley is in green, as is traditionanal for the lower house, as is the red upper house, the Legislative Council. I have visited Parliament House several times, it's a pity it's so difficult to get inside
2;Opening Parliament House;Enjoyed a guided tour during Seniors Week. A small group of 25 was able to view both Houses and see and hear behind the scenes of government. Our exceptional guide Michael, was amazing with his historical presentation. A wealth of knowledge of W A history. With a lovely morning tea it was certainly a morning to remember
2;Excelkent;I was the only person on the free 10.30am tour and it was excellent. Sarah, the guide, was extremely knowledgeable both about the building and its history, but also the legislative process. I would recommend the tour highly to anyone who has an enquiring mind about how and why laws are enacted. I even got to sit in the Speaker’s chair in the lower house. Great views over the city too, from in front of the Parliament building.
2;Difficult to be open to the public and secure at the same time;Despite the free tours on Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, Parliament House does not really feel welcoming. I understand the dilemma between being open to the public (who you claim to represent) and closed and suspicious for reasons of security. When I approached the building on foot with a small backpack, the guards were immediately alert. I liked the modern (eastern) part more than the 1904 section, because the former has more glass in its facade and looks more transparent, while the older secion feels more closed and designed to impress the visitor. Still not bad considering the time when it was built.
2;Limited parking and not always open;We visited on a Wednesday and was disappointed as tours are not held every day. Parking was expensive and behind the building. There was visitor parking at front and side of building however we were told that this was not for the public and parking inspectors were very active. We did not go back at we felt it was not worth the effort a second time!
2;Good visit;Good free tour of the WA Parliament, friendly and knowledgeable tour guide. Went on a day that parliament was sitting had a good view from the public gallery
2;A Perth Icon;This parliament house has some interesting history. It's best going with a local to get the low down.
2;Nice place for a stroll;Look, its a nice place to go for a walk or something if your into that kind of thing. I MIGHT do it again in a month.
3;Excellent library;It is good library for those who would like to explore in-depth research in law, health, politic and others. I feel the librarian also helpful. We could bring our children and put them in children section so they could enjoy kids event. It has easy access in the city and free events as long as you register first. You could apply membership for borrowing some books and DVDs and the card will be sent to your address. Recommended.
3;Well presented exhibits with interactive displays for kids.;Well presented exhibits with interactive displays for kids. Suitable for all ages and abilities. Inrecomment starting from the 3rd floor and working your way down. The bottom level is a lot of indigenous paintings and history.
3;Treasure house of knowledge;The State Library of Western Australia (SLWA) is a treaure house of knowledge. Many books relate to WA. It is a fine place to read and research. The Battye Library is WA's best source for local history.
3;Repository of knowledge;No other institution can match the State Library of Western Australia (SLWA) as a repository of knowledge about Australia's western third. It has an excellent collection, based mainly on material to do with WA. The Battye Library has a comprehensive collection of material to do with WA local history. The Library is a comfortable place to read and research.
3;Beautiful Facility;If you are looking for novels to read, don't go to the state library of WA. They cater more to educational reading and research books. They have a massive library, so whatever you are studying I'm sure they have an abundance of reading material for you.
3;Treasure-trove for curious visitors;For anyone wanting to find out about Western Australia, the State Library of Western Australia (SLWA) is a good starting point. For local history, the Battye Library is a resource that cannot be surpassed. The SLWA has many books about WA which are not duplicated elsewhere, The library often has interesting exhibitions. By the way, you can't get a library card if you are not a resident of WA. The history of WA is quite fascinating, full of booms and busts.
3;Make sure you have an acceptable mask before entering;Nice building with good services and extensive collections. But............no entry without and approved mask Home-made masks not permitted, bandanas not permitted. Have visited numerous other venues...including the nearby WA Museum over the last couple of days with no issue. But SLWA was adament that the home-made mask was unacceptable. However, they DID provide a free acceptable mask to allow entry. So not all bad
3;Bookworm haven;Cool, spacious, helpful staff and interesting exhibitions to visit at various times of the year. 2 gallery spaces
3;Bringing literacy to Western Australia;The State Library of Wesern Australia (SLWA) is a research, reference and lending library. You must have a SLWA membership ticket, which is limited to residents of WA, to borrow books. The computers can be ued by visitors. The library is very comfortable, far better than the old one. The Battye Library specialises in WA history, it is a boon for people reserching WA history. The SLWA is in Northbridge, it's easy to find.
3;Lovely, modern structure library;This library is well worth a visit, even if only to get a coffee. It has plenty of seating areas, and reading areas, lifts for those that can't climb stairs and helpful staff.
4;Little Chinatown in Perth;Wanted to see and experience the influence of early and current Chinese migrants in Perth. But there was little to be see albeit many Chinese and Asian eateries.
4;Never again!;Went out to a club to enjoy a band, but seriously felt fearful. Streets were full of underaged, indigenous, drunks, drugged, angry people. We were threatened as we walked through Yagan Square to Rosies by 4 indigenous drunk angry females. Perth Underground railway was just as bad. Sad to see Northbridge taken over by violence.
4;Lovely but can be dangerous & unpredictable;Although Northbridge is where you'll find some great cafes & restaurants, excellent street art, galleries and our state museum and library it isn't the safest place to venture. During the day it may well be family friendly however it isn't without its troubles and when the sun goes down I wouldn't recommend staying around in this area. A lot of potential but it's very unpredictable and can become quite dangerous at times, especially at night.
4;Not Worth A Second Visit;Brief walk around Northbridge & nothing to write home about, just a mix of cafe's restaurants & nightclubs. Caught the Blackcat free Blue Route Bus & personally Northbridge appears to attract the younger crowd.
4;A suburb unto itself;Northbrige is north of the Perth Railway Station, over the bridge, Northbridge was declared a suburb unto itself in the 1980s. Yagan Square is just to the south. Northbridge is Perth's main nightlife area. It has the reputation for being a bit seedy, especially after midnight, but there is usually a strong police presence. Bars and 'hole-in-the-wall' ethiic eateries are everywhere. I took an out-of-town visitor who only eats hamburgers to Northbridge and we had a good time. If someone starts acting in a peculiar manner, make yourself scarce.
4;Chinatown;Northbridge is so much better than it used to be. Don't get me wrong, as with all entertainment districts, it gets seedy after midnight especially for drink or drug related behaviour. The Piazza, great bars and restaurants are definitely the draw card for me. But, my favourite is still Chinatown nearest Roe St where you can get a great inexpensive Asian meal and BYO drinks. We generally come here as a first port of call for our meals or jaunts into the city.
4;Okay;Northbridge has some nice places to go to for mainly younger people, with many nightclubs, but there also some nice restaurants there. However, it tends to be looked at as more of a 'grubby' place in Perth.
4;The old part.;Just beyond the very modern Jagan Square is the older area of Northbridge. Apart from being the Art Centre of the city Northbridge has some classic colonial style buildings and some great shops. It also has some excellent bars and eateries as well as the iconic Paradiso cinema
4;Interesting Area;This is an interesting place to visit especially during Fringe Festival. Lots of restaurants and nightclubs. During Fringe it has A number of Fringe venues.
4;Not for Everyone;Northbridge is not for everyone. It is actually a great place full of well priced restaurants bars and other forms of entertainment. Locals scowl about going in because it's not safe but this is an overstatement. Yes... It can be dodgy at night, especially during the early hours of the morning (after midnight) but it has a fantastic vibe when will the club's and crowds get going. By day, its safe as, apart from some homeless that hang around but they usually keep to themselves apart from some loud banter.
4;Tacky and noisy;Nothing to commend this area of Perth apart from backpackers, cheap horrible food, lousy coffee and run down street scape. If you are down on your luck you will find cheap accommodation and something to eat which is also cheap...if you can stomach it.

6;Supreme Court gardens;Once again another beautiful garden in Perth. Not too sure what it is but the grass is very green in Perth. The flowers are stunning.
6;Tranquil and serene;Going here was a shame as the whole gardens were blocked as they were under construction from January to February so we couldn't see anything happening inside.
6;Just Beautiful;These beautiful gardens never disappoint, they are well kept, you have large ponds with birdlife, great place to have your wedding
6;Gardens surround WA's highest court;The Supreme Court Gardens surround the Supreme Court, the highest court in the State of Western Australia. The Gardens are meticulously maintained by the gardeners. who spare no effort in keeping the gardens' flowers and lawn beautiful. Anyone can enter the Supreme Court Gardens, city workers can often be seen having an impromptu picnic at lunchtime. Entry is free.
6;City Oasis;Lovely park area in the city, this was the first time that we had visited since the 1980's and many changes were evident, improved access to and around the area. Well maintained with an expansive lawned area, seating, walk tracks, trees and other flora, monuments, etc. Reading a history of the gardens later, I found it difficult to imagine that they were much smaller in area when established in 1845 and that an area of the Swan foreshore had been reclaimed in 1903 giving us he expanse of gardens and other adjacent facilities that we take for granted.
6;It's where I work;This is not so much a review as a comment to correct some misinformation I noted from looking at some of the reviews, particularly with respect to the location of the Supreme Court Gardens, and Stirling Gardens. The Supreme Court building sits in the middle of the Supreme Court Gardens (to the South of the Court and riverside) and Stirling Gardens which is to the north of the Court. Stirling Gardens are in fact on the corner of Barrack Street and St George's Terrace (NOT Adelaide Terrace as some say and as appears in the above description. I don't know how that gets corrected). Supreme Court Gardens are bounded by Barrack Street, Riverside Drive and Governors Avenue. Don't go looking for Adelaide Terrace as it is some distance down the road to the east of Barrack Street.  If you visit either garden it is just a short walk to the other. Cross Barrack Street and you are in the Elizabeth Quay precinct, and to the south of the gardens is Barrack Square where you will also find the Bell Tower. There are a number of places to eat at Barrack Square and Elizabeth Quay. On a fine day both gardens are worth visiting, and it is nice to just sit a while and enjoy the peaceful surroundings. I love the massive Moreton Bay Fig trees in both gardens. There is an enormous specimen near the Perth City Council building in Stirling Gardens and several other large trees down Barrack Street and behind the Court in the Supreme Court Gardens.
6;Manicured gardens in the heart of Perth;
6;Relax to the max;The Supreme Court is the highest court in the State of Western Australia. These days, security is tight and it is not easy to enter the court room. The gardens, however, are free for anyone to enter, and city workers can often be seen eating their sandwiches there at lunchtime. The Gardens are beautifully maintained in classic style. They can be found at the corner of Barrack St and Adelaide Terrace. There is also a statue of renowned explorer Alexander Forrest at the corner.
6;Supreme location;The Supreme Court Gardens adjoins the Supreme Court of Western Austrrlia. The Supreme Court of WA is the highest court in the State. You can see the Supreme Court from outside, in these days of security consciousness, you may have to go through an inspection process if you wish to enter the court. The Supreme Court Gardens are quite beautiful, it's a favourite place for city workers to eat tehir sandwches and get some sun.
6;Scenic gardens in the heart of Perth;This is an amazing reserve which was created into a garden area over 100 years ago. It used to be part of the Swan River shallows but was reclaimed in early 1900s into a grass land with trees later planted upon in in the early 1920s. This is situated in the CBD with the Supreme Court taking the centrestage for use. This is still a functioning court.
6;Under construction, couldn't see much.;Going here was a shame as the whole gardens were blocked as they were under construction from January to February so we couldn't see anything happening inside.
6;Relaxing;Once again another beautiful
6;A nice spot for a rest;Lovely gardens right in the heart of Perth city. The famous kangaroo 🦘 statues face the street. Very peaceful place. I loved the variety of trees.
7;Gardens & Sculptures;Located adjacent the Supreme Court Gardens, these gardens date to 1830 when botanist James Drummond used the area to propagate seed specimens. It was declared a botanical garden in 1845. Also a lovely area, well maintained, great flora specimens, the majestic Moreton Bay Fig, water features and the sculptures.
7;Green garden among the grey;Stirling Gardens is at the intersection of St George's Terrace and Barrack Street, to the west of Government House. It's probably the best-known corner in Perth. Stirling Gardens contains a number of monuments. the most impresssive is the statue of Alexander Forrest (1849-1901). With his brother (Lord) John Forest he explored much of Western Australia's remote regions, in particular the Kimberley in the State's Far North. He was a member of the WA Parliament and twice Lord Mayor of Perth. As Perth has grown, its history has often been overwhelmed by office towers. This park is a piece of Peth that has been preserved.
7;An explorer of great achievments;Alexander Forrest CMG (1849-1901) was,along with his brother (Lord) John Forrest, one of the last great explorers of inland Australia. His party, taking five months, travelled oveland from Perth to Adelaide. His greatest achievemt, among many, was to open the Kimberley to setrtlment. He was later Member of the Legislative Council (MLC) and Member of the Legislative Assembley (MLA) for the Kimberley in the Parliament of Western Australia. He was also Lord Mayor of Perth on two occasions. Alexaner Forrest's statue is at the corner of St Georges Tce and Barrack St, near the entrance to Stirling Gardens Famously, he is shown holding a sextant, which is on occasion stolen and replaced wih a bottle of beer, a sorry fate for a giant among men.
7;A Small Patch Of Green On Barrack Street And St George's Terrace;Stirling Gardens sits on the edge of the C.B.D at the corner of St George's Terrace and Barrack Street and provide a welcome patch of green and open space that becomes Government House and the area of the Supreme Court and the associated gardens.Neat and good gardens and worthy of a stroll through.
7;A lovely little garden.;There's nothing like a small piece of green in the midst of tall buildings in the city. This is a quiet little garden with some flowers, a small pond and it serves as a picnic spot for locals.
7;Nice Breathing Space;Right smack dab in town proper the Stirling Gardens run into the Supreme Court gardens & area. Really good public space & some nice & different tree species ! God for a relaxing stroll and used heavily during the lunch period.
7;Nice Gardens;Really nice kept gardens and was really pleasant walking through it. The gardens are very peaceful and has water areas for drinks. I love the cast Kangaroos to the front of the Gardens along Adelaide Terracae.
7;Nice BBQ facilities;Hard to believe this used to be a rubbish tip. Nice location for a picnic with free barbecues available. There are also some tables and benches. Exiting the carpark and turning right is inconvenient - necessary to enter the council carpark across the road and do a u-turn.
7;Bijou gardens a symbol of Perth;Stirling Gardens are on the corner of St George's Terrace and Barrack Street. Out the front is a statue of Alexander Forrest, brother of the first Premier of Western Australia, Sir John Forrest. Alexander Forrest was an explorer The gardens are beautifully kept, and can be confused with the adjoining Supreme Court Gardens to the south. It's a favorite place for city workers to get some rays and eat their lunch. The gardens are named after Capt James Stirling, first governor of the Swan River Colony.
7;Small but worth a visit;This is only a small garden and part of it was being renovated when we visited but it is a lovely space with some life size kangaroo statues.
7;Quills;Small park close to the Supreme court gardens. It has paths that lead from the street towards the courts. Nice park like most of the ones in Perth. This one has a sculpture of quills on Barrack Street side of the park. It is just down the road from the bell tower.
8;Beautiful Gardens;Beautiful gardens and park.... lots of ducks and a statue of Peter Pan..... one of only 4 from the mould (the original is in London). Could probably do with a coffee shop or similar which will mean your can stay there longer!
8;Tranquil Setting;A beautiful tranquil garden filled with birdsong. Occasionally the peace is broken by the Kookaburra or the noisy Corellas. In the centre is a collection of ponds which are filled with wildfowl. Plenty of benches and reasonable clean toilets. Easy to get to as on the Red Cat bus route.
8;Very neat and tidy gardens;A very nice, extremely manicured garden. The ponds are beautiful. You can tell that a lot of care goes into maintaining these gardens.
8;OUR FIRST VISIT;Cant believe that we have been here since 1981 and this is the first time we have been to this lovely park area. Well worth a trip
8;A lovely quiet park;Although much smaller than I expected, it was still a tranquil park and made for a lovely 45 minute stroll. Even at 8:30-9am the park was still very quiet, with only a couple of other people around. Would definitely be good for picnics as there's lots of grass and benches to watch the ducks from. The park is easily accessible from the CBD via the Red CAT bus, which drops you off at the front gates.
8;Children love Peter Pan statue;Queens Gardens is full of lakes. This area was once full of claypits, which made the bricks that built Perth in the colonial days. Queens Park is beloved of generations of Perth children for the statue of Peter Pan, an exact replica of the Peter Pan statue in Kensington Gardens in London. If you look carefully at the statue, you can see fairies, lizards and many other marvelous creatures. Queens Park is a refuge from Perth's ever-increasing traffic. it's well worth a visit.
8;A quiet, secluded park in the city;A quiet, secluded park in the city where you can admire the swans, ducks, the lake and large trees. Very relaxing and chill area. It is also very tidy and clearly very well maintained. Would visit again!
8;From claypit to gardens;Our first visit to Queens Gardens and very impressed with the expanses of lawn, water features, assorted flora, birdlife and the Peter Pan statue. Heavy rain overnight resulted in much of the lower lawn levels being either waterlogged or under water but didn't detract from the serenity of the area. An oasis among the concrete jungle that surrounds.
8;Kings park is better;Perth has many wonderful parks. This is another one. It is a little bit hidden away, which makes it a go to place during the busier tourist season for me. But during quieter times I prefer kings park
8;Hidden gem;A lovely and very well maintained garden tucked away in Perth amongst them city. If you need to get out of the office and enjoy the serenity then this is a nice place to walk and relax.
8;Every garden has it's history and this is no exception;Any walk through a city should include visiting the gardens, especially those that have been established for a long time. This one is spacious with winding paths and there is the seat made famous in the movie Notting Hill. A Peter Pan statue overlooks a lovely lake and when we were, there black swans and cygnets were enjoying the sunshine.
8;Hidden away;Being so close to work, I either pass by or stop for a break regularly. This is a small but attractive park with lots of wildlife. It has a lake and lots of grassed area where you can just lay back and enjoy the tranquillity. It is situated next to the WACA and the CAT bus stops right next door to the park so it is easy to access by free transportation. As it is also in East Perth its an easy walk to the Casino via the causeway.  This is hidden away and not easy to spot if you didn't know it was there. It's also next door to the Gloucester Park trotting ground. Worth a visit.
8;Best known for Peter Pan;Queens Gardens are best known for the statue of Peter Pan, taken from J M Barrie's classic story. Generations of Perth children have examined the Peter Pan statue closely, trying to find the fairies.. There's also the Notting Hill bench, supposedly derived from the film. Queens Gardens has lots of ponds -- that's because the area was a brickwoks with claypits from 1860 to 1890. Many of Perth's heritage buidlings, including the Town Hall, were constructed with bricks from Queens Gardens. The Gardens are in the East of the city, it's a good place for morning tea.
8;Relaxing park to sit in.;This park, along with all the parks in Perth, is very well maintained. Lots of chairs to sit on and beautiful shady trees to sit under. Bring a rug, baguette and some cheese and a book.
9;Here for Fringe - grab a show;Here for Fringe - grab a show Le Aerial GO SEE IT next best thing to Cirque du Soleil All credit to the artists of this magnificent show
9;PARK BETWEEN James Street .;I'f you know Perth... you would understand that this park is not a safe place to be at night . please be cautious. beautiful trees and over 150 years of history
9;;Great parks for events I visited during the Fringe Festival where there were many stalls for food and entertainment wouldn't recommend for children but when there's an event on can't be beat
9;;Great little park in North Bridge. Very peaceful with a kids playground
9;;I didn't measure the angles but I tend to take squares at face value nowadays. I mean, why would they be lying about 90 degree corners and parallel sides? Too much hassle otherwise, not to mention risky, claiming square heritage and whatnot without it being fully traceable
9;;Beautiful, peaceful and quiet park. Very well maintain. (2022-09)
9;;Went to the Godz Fringe World performance. Cannot praise the show enough, it was fabulous, the performers delightful, thoroughly enjoyed myself.
9;;Went to fringe world and hit up the silent disco.. so much fun
9;;The square turns into a Pleasure Garden for the Fringe festival between end of Jan and end of Feb. Best place to spend your evenings ever
9;;Nice place and was more entertaining with the Fringe Festival going on....Best time to visit is during the Fringe festival.lots of shows and activities..
9;;Was there for durian fest and Malaysian foods. Not bad. Not bad.
9;;Fringe Festival was amazing. Well set up and lots of entertainment.  Bring cash as a lot have no eftpos.
10;Loved Kings Park and Botanic Gardens;Loved this amazing, peaceful place. Endless choices to spend trekking through the various pathways and locations, learning about the flora of the state, sitting in restaurant and cafe style eateries on-site, or picnicking with family or friends. It is obviously a great meeting place being right in the heart of the city overlooking beautiful vistas of the Swan River and surrounds. Free buses service the area, and there are multiple ways in and out. Perth certainly spends time ensuring the whole park is well-kept and constantly maintained to a world-class standard.
10;A must-visit destination in Australia;It's a beautiful park with winding paths and stunning views of the city. There are also plenty of sculptures and playgrounds for kids to enjoy. The gift shop is full of souvenirs and gifts to take home. It's a perfect place to spend a day outdoors with family and friends. Highly recommended!
10;The best botanical gardens in Australia;These gardens are truly amazing. So well organised and full of plants that are local to Western Australia but found in many other parts of Australia. Spectacular views over Perth. Be careful about using the scooters as they have limitations in this area and won’t work in a large part of the park
10;A great place to relax;A stunning outdoor space with vast lawns, winding paths, playgrounds and a café. It's a great place to explore nature, get some exercise, or just relax and take in the views. The café is a great spot for a bite to eat or a hot drink, and the playgrounds are great for kids. Highly recommended!
10;Nice to visit;It has interactive displays, a café, tranquil lakes and an amphitheatre. The park is a great place to relax and explore nature. There are many walks and trails to explore, and the views are spectacular. The café is a great place to stop and have a bite to eat. The amphitheatre is a great spot to watch performances and enjoy the outdoors. The interactive displays are great for kids and adults alike. All in all, Kings Park and Botanic Garden is a great place to explore and relax.
10;Breath taking Kings Park Perth;Breath taking, glorious, spectacular is what you can bring to mind when entering and wandering this massive inviting Park. Perth city proper overlooking the majestic Swan River is the panoramic view you observe from ground level of this finest Park as the name implies. One visit will not be enough as you know a return to the Kings is a must.
10;careful with little ones on the path lined with shards;Vast and interesting to explore however our little one tripped on the path which is mixed in with shards of metal or something which sliced up his knees awful. It caught on his shoe tripping him.
10;Beautiful gardens;Beautiful gardens - we spent a really pleasant few hours strolling through - everything's so well maintained. Great views over the water to the city. If you're in the area, I would certainly recommend visiting.
10;Probably the best location to view the water and the city;Beautifully kept garden with a vast variety of native flora species. The views over the water are some of the best in Perth. Immaculately maintained (to a significant extent, by hard-working and friendly volunteers)! There was also a very nice cafe/coffee shop and gift shop. Very impressed!
10;The best park by far that I have ever visited.;10 out of 10 for its location, the views, the cleanliness, the facilities and the sheer beauty of the place. I could live there.
10;;
11;Lovely family park;Only five minutes drive from Perth City. Lovely to visit for a picnic or photography pictures . A lovely lake with Birdlife. Trees are very beautiful look forward to see them in the Autumn.
11;Walk along the lakes;We brought some lunch to have a picnic here since it was a nice day. We ate near the water playground area just by the grassy bank. The park was quite large and fairly busy, particularly the playground. I enjoyed walking along the two lakes of the park, watching the birds swimming about as well as people watching for a bit. There were also a few information boards around the park talking about the history or the animals in the park. It was nice to wander around and rest on grassy patches or benches when required. It was a nice park to visit with nice views and quite a nice atmosphere of everyone enjoying themselves. Definitely worth bringing things over for a picnic.
11;Beautiful shady Park;Grab a coffee from chu bakery across the road and then go for a walk around this place such a nice way to spend the day highly recommended
11;An oasis of shade in the summer;Having visited this park in the summer, what we were very pleased with was the presence of large, tall trees which, in addition to being beautiful, guarantee a situation of widespread shade over a large part of the green area. A very welcome situation on Perth's hot summer days. These are introduced trees such as plane trees, Port Jackson and Moreton Bay figs, and pines, all of which are large in size. Located in the suburb of Highgate, this park is surrounded by streets where there are many parking spaces although many are limited to 2 or 3 parking hours. There are public toilets, benches, fitness equipment, gazebos, tables and barbeques and a playground (this is the only part of the park where a little more shade would be needed). There is a sealed walking path around the small lake which is divided into two basins each of which with an islet in the middle. In consideration of the fact that this park is very popular and busy, the two islets provide an adequate refuge for the local fauna consisting of birds and southwestern snake-necked turtles. During our visit there were two ice cream and coffee vans where we bought cold slushes. Definitely a very nice and well managed park that is worth a visit especially in summer.
11;Great spot;Nice park. Well laid out. Easy to take a stroll around. Fairly popular on a very ordinary winters day. Looks like lots for kids to do. Also provided some fitness equipment. Be sure to look out for the chessboard sculpture. No litter. Parking quite east when we came here.
11;Lovely surroundings;Love love love! Very lovely surrounding and all a short distance to the city. There are also ice cream vans and coffee to keep you going
11;Great for a picnic or a stroll on a sunny day;Hyde park is only just out of the City - a 15-29 minute walk from the CBD. It is hardly large, but for locals an visitors alike it has very nice grounds and gardens. Kids can play in the playground, there are BBQs and plenty of space to put down a picnic blanket. Sort of old fashioned, yet quite a lot of families and young people also enjoy this space.
11;Best place to spend a day out;If you are ever stressed in Perth come here Use the barbecues bring a few beers and the footy and then everything is alright
11;Inner city park with an abundance of foliage;Perth has a Mediterranean climate -- cool winters and summer drought, so It is a difficult climate to cultivate European trees. Hyde Park with its groves of European plants is quite special. Hyde Park's inner city location is a well-known venue for weddings and other gatherings. The annual Hyde Park Fair is a free, long-running community event, held annually.
11;Married here, best park in Perth;Best park in Perth by far, offers shade, a water playgrounds as well as two other playgrounds for children, barbecue facilities as well as being located close to the CBD.
12;Rather Ordinary;Although this is a large airy building it rather lacks something. The Indigenous exhibition. You also are not allowed to take in the smallest handbags even though mine was only big enough for my phone and purse. Hey ho I can deal with that what I cannot tolerate are rude and surly members of staff.
12;Unexplained removal of everything the guide book tells you is there;We are open to new experiences but it was very disappointing to find almost all the masterpieces we expected to see removed. I’m not going to jump to conclusions like other recent reviews but some explanation of what has happened to the permanent collection, which has disappeared during COVID, is due for the visitors. And just closing off the amazing Centennial wing without any explanation is weird to say the least. We enjoyed the contrasting art in the Dis/possession exhibition and the show of 1950s neglected women artists. However please note someone has vandalised “Down on his luck” - one of the famous paintings of the Gallery, also now removed. Perhaps AGWA don’t know you can actively turn off people with open minds, and the few people who champion the arts, if you go this far trying to rewrite the past.
12;Engaging artwork and a break from the city heat;Excellent pieces throughout, well displayed and not overwhelming. We enjoyed taking our time with the family, discussing each of the pieces and the range of modern to traditional paintings and sculptures. We didn't quite manage to see it all, but as entry is free, it is easy to return another day. Enjoyed the break from the Perth heat and the tranquility of the gallery for a couple of hours. Even the Gallery cafe was top quality. Ground level was the highlight for us, and we were happy to take more time here and then skim the upper levels.
12;Decent galley with an unusual entrance;Not a bad gallery. It has some interesting pieces. My favourites were the Heysen works. The entrance to the place is unusual. It’s either genius or madness and perhaps a bit of both. The entrance from ground level is truly bizarre. The only way in is from the back of the ground level car park. What they really want you to do is come in as a pedestrian via a first level platform or bridge that joins or passes the excellent Perth train station.
12;Too WOKE and thoroughly disappointing!;AGWA has dropped most of their traditional artworks, including some world greats, in an effort to appease the WOKE generation. Such a shame as I used to love wandering through the new exhibits. If you love art and the masters, leave this poor excuse behind.
12;Great free tours and local artists.;We did a FREE Highlights tour with Jill and she was amazing. I loved that the gallery tries to highlight Western Australian and Indigenous artists. It was lovely to see the modern next to the classic.
12;So much to see, feel, appreciate and enjoy;So much to see, feel, appreciate and enjoy. The volunteers are all so pleasant, polite, helpful and friendly. It has been an incredible experience. We visited the gallery twice during our one week holiday in Perth. There is no entrance fee. Donation is welcomed. Thank you AGwa! Well done!!
12;Less than disappointing. Don’t bother.;This place is a disgrace. Where can we view important artworks of the colonial period? Or representations of the great western artistic traditions? Nope. All we get is gallery after gallery of shoddy mediocrity. Western Australia deserves better!!
12;Detail of my visit;There was only a little of the few exhibitions on display that I liked. What spoilt my visit and experience was later realising after my visit there on October 22, that the Volunteer Coordinator there, had no intention of contacting me, after I had a conversation with her (which she started where the Lester Prize entrants was displayed) and I offered to later have a look at her own art work sent electronically. I wrote and left my contact details on paper at the nearby counter. But I was never contacted by her, because I am not a local living in Perth.
12;A Fiasco of a Show;Extremely disappointing. Where are the historical masterpieces by Van Gogh, Cezanne, Ben Nicholson, Sir Terry Frost and countless others? Instead of space for the marvellous as well as the miraculous in modern art, they have been substituted by inferior paintings that barely merit a second glance.
12;Not really what we'd hoped for but still worth visiting;Having read recent reviews we were forewarned about the dearth of classic European and Australian artworks on display. We found the Lester Prize exhibition interesting but felt that too little credit was given to talented and more experienced artists. The exhibition Dis/Possession  ppeared to attempt to compare and contrast Indigenous and Classic, European-influenced Australian art. For us it failed. The Australian art in the European tradition and the Indigenous works appeared to have little in common. While you could argue that they both depicted the land and  personal experiences, they remained alien to one another and seemed completely at odds on the wall. Regardless of the above, there were masterpieces in the exhibition that were worth visiting the AGWA: the works by Namatjira, Heysen, McCubbin, Gruner and Rover Thomas stood out for us above everything else. The adjacent Collective Ground Indigenous exhibition was magnificently displayed and included superb and attractive works, as well as plenty of thought-provoking pieces. Really worthwhile spending time there. The cafe produced fine coffee and tasty banana bread. We hope the gallery will re-introduce Western art to give a more balanced view of our artistic heritage.
12;Go woke go broke;Go woke , go broke. Classics are classics for a reason. Down on his luck , quite literally for the people responsible for managing what was once an art gallery. Now more of a Fremantle market displaying art.
12;Not worth it any more;Very disappointing the gallery has decided it will only display art for half the population, and so remove the history and downgrade the experience and deep history of the rest of the population. Not worth the entrance fee any longer (and yes I know it is free).
13;Fascinating insight into history;The replica of the Brig Amity is so interesting and the commentary gives a fascinating insight into life at sea and in the colony in the early 1800s.
13;Great museum;Excellent gem of a museum from its meteorite to the lighthouse optics. The information centre part was an excellent overview of the history of Albany and going on the Brig was good fun. Well worth a visit!!
13;Good to visit;A lovely walk around this small museum. Lots of reading to do about wildlife, aboriginal life and sea life. Won't take long to look around but worth a visit.
13;An excellent museum;We started here with a visit to the Museum of the Great Southern an excellent informative museum with interesting picture boards covering the history of Albany from prehistoric times. They show a great 3D movie upstairs about the sinking of two ships off the coast at shark bay through the war. They didn't find the ships for a long time but when they did they recorded their findings and made this movie, it is not very long but well worth watching. We walked from here through a couple of the old building, one of them the old school house and then made our way over to the replica of the Brig Amity. This is an amazing reproduction of what would have been a beautiful ship.
13;Good Local Info;gret to spend a couple of hours on a wet day..loved the aboriginal information and eco building...all free. $5 for the prison and well worth it.
13;Excellent really worth some time.;We really enjoyed our time here, the staff were really friendly and informative. The exhibits are well done, some interactive Loved the school room too. Free but a donation is possible. It’s worth it.
13;Great museum;Good couple of hours here. The displays and audio tour of the replica of the Amity (small charge for audio tour) are informative without giving you information overload. The discovery centre is great for all ages - hands on exhibits explaining scientific concepts using everyday materials - better than Scitech in Perth we thought. Staff are friendly and helpful.
13;GREAT;this is place for any age. The displays are fantastic with a lot of history about Albany. Donations help the running of these buildings.
13;Pleasant Surprise;Very impressed with this unintended visit to the museum. We were visiting the Brig Amity with our toddler and I wandered into the beautiful historic buildings. We were greeted by very friendly and knowledgeable staff who were happy to inform us of what was happening in their space at the moment. The exhibitions were great. My son had a great time with the activities and there wasn't an entrance fee. Donations were given and accepted. A great find for a day out in Albany.
13;Excellent;I thoroughly enjoyed my visit here. Loads of local information and fantastic displays of the many artefacts throughout the museum and its grounds. Definately a Must Do.
13;Good Visit;Well worth a wonder round added bonus its free, had some very interesting information. As well as the main building it has several out buildings of interest
13;Brilliant, interactive and educational;A great way to spend a few hours. There are both free, fee and donation exhibitions. We visited as a family with a grandparent, mum and preteen girl. We all enjoyed it very much and learnt about Albany’s and WA’s history.
13;Good;Good information . It was an interesting visit .Good to know the local history. The historic precinct is a smallish area and easy to visit three places at once.
13;WA's oldest sedttlement;Albany was first settled by Europeans in 1826, well before the British sedtled the Swan River Colony in 1829. As WA's first settlement, Albany has lots of things to see. The Perth Museum has effectively ceased to exist. The Albany branch of the Western Australian Museum has much to offer. You can see a reproduction of the brig Amity, in which the first settlers arrived. Also, the history of the Great Southern tells an interesting tale
14;Do the Tour - well worth it;Booked a tour of the actual site  and it was well worth the visit simply to hear the history of the place - speed-car racing who would have known.<br>Totally different to being there as a spectator.<br>Being shown areas usually out of bounds to the general public and hearing the history was terrific. Wow do those broadcasters have an excellent view.
14;Caught Marsh, bowled Lillee;The WACA saw one of the greatest combination of wickets takers in Australian cricket, with wicket keeper Rodney Marsh and express paceman Dennis Lillee, caught Marsh, bowled Lillee. Both were Western Australians, who teamed up to make a great cricketing wicket taking combinastion. that is yet to be broken.
14;A Great Evening;We decided to watch a Scorcher match, and were thoroughly hooked. A great ground with a fantastic atmosphere, shame it's going.
14;Home of cricket in Western Australia;The WACA Ground, or more usually the Waca is the home of cricket in WA. Officially,  the Western Australian Cricket Association. These days, major games such as Ashes Tests are played at Optus Stadium, but Sheffield Sheild games are still played at the WACA, as are women's games. Test matches began here  in 1970 who could forget  local boys Dennis Lillee and Rodney Marsh combining to take yet another wicket?
14;Bradman room lunch for One day cup v Tas;Regular visitor to Bradman room when able to make the trip and almost never disappoints.<br>Was looked after by the lovely Jenny whose friendly face and polite sunny disposition an added bonus. She would be an asset to any company. <br>Meals are large and very well priced as are some top quality local wines available by both glass and bottle. <br>Best of luck with the rest of your studies Jenny and look forward to you paying a visit to the Ferguson Valley soon
14;Sails Cafe and Bar;Not many people know that the WACA has a bar and a cafe. Lobbed in this afternoon before the footy for a quick beer but decided to linger for nachos and a hotdog. Very good, very good value for money. Great music too. If your on your way to the footy, this is great pit stop.
14;Sunburn;If you are looking for a place to get sun burnt and pay exorbitant prices for terrible food and drink, the WACA is your place.
14;The WACA tour is a must if you like cricket. Maybe Perth's best attraction.;The WACA tour is truly excellent, especially if you are a cricket fan. You get access to all areas including the players changerooms and on to the ground. Highlight is the room with a stump from each test ever played at the WACA with the scores and each players name. Perhaps the best tour in Perth. Don't miss it. The museum, where the tour starts is also fascinating so allow at least an hour to look through that.
14;welltravelled 2019;Appreciate there is a new ground which they are all very proud of but I just had to visit the WACA one more time ,tour available, Will never forget this icon of test cricket with late arrival of the Fremantle doctor each day ,the very lively pitch with Lillee and Thompson putting the fear of God into the opposition. Suggest a  great visit to make when in Perth for all cricket lovers
14;A must for any Cricket Fan;My husband loved the musium lots of memoribilia, crickiting history at its best. We just caught the Free CAT bus got off at the Wacca stop and had a look around ourselves, but tours are available.
14;Beautiful stadium;I had the pleasure of visiting this stadium to view the Final between VIC and WS for the Veterans Cricket Interstate Tournament. The ground and pitch was in stunning condition, the original lighting towers from the 1970s still in place. This was one of the places that started the One Day Cricket revolution of coloured uniforms and fast, entertaining cricket. Day/Night cricket and the Australian triseries, coupled with the advent of satellite TV brought cricket to the masses and has made it the game it is today, one of the world's most popular team sports.
14;A really personalised tour;It was a last minute decision to visit the WACA, but one we were very pleased we made.<br>We were the only two people on the tour so we had our guide Roy all to ourselves.<br>He was very knowledgeable and friendly and took us into almost every nook and cranny of the ground.<br>He even took some photos of the two of us on the pitch so we have a record of this fantastic experience.<br>
15;Much-loved WA institution sponsors stadium;The Hospital Benefit Fund (HBF) is a large not-for-profit healthcare fund that is based in Western Australia. The HBF is a much-loved WA institution, it sponsors the HBF Park. HBF Park is a triangular stadium suited to soccer, regby league and rugby union. HBF Park allows big-occasion matches to be played in Perth. HBF Park is walking distance to the Perth CBD. big games attract large crowds.
15;Home ground for rectangular sports;Certain sports are popular in Western Australia and others are not so popular. The Wildcats are popular, as are the Eagles and Dockers. HBF Park caters for 'rectangular' sports, such as soccer, rugby union and rugby league, that on occasion can draw a big crowd for a big game. It's a good venue for performers, such as English balladeer Ed Sheeran. By the way, HBF stands for Hospital Benefit Fund, a not-for-profit health fund that dominates the health insurance industry in WA.
15;Perth's rectangular stadium;HBF Park is officially called Perth Stadium. It's a rectangular set-up and hosts soccer and rugby games. It admitted 32,000 music fans to listen to English balladeer Ed Sheeran. HBF stands for the Hospital Benefit Fund, a large not-for-profit health insurance fund headquartered in Western Australia. HBF Park is not far from the centre of Pertth
15;Great venue for concerts;We went to see Elton John in concert and had a great view of the stage from the stands. It was very easy to get to by public transport and there were plenty of staff around to help. A very positive experience.
15;Great Small Venue;Field was very nice, lighting was awesome. Good venue to watch the Western Force. Tired bar and food in the old stand. Beer prices a little high.
15;Fun Perth Glory Soccer Experience;We visited NIB Stadium to watch Perth Glory play. What a lovely stadium and a great size for the soccer. It was easy to enter with the simple ticketing entry process (we had our tickets be purchased). After we entered there were lots of activities for adults and kids on lovely grass area. We had a ball and my daughter even won a prize. The best bit was it was enclosed in the stadium which meant I didn't have to worry about my kids running on the road. During the game there was the fan cam and Karaoke. We all got into singing and clapping along. I felt like I was part of a special community. If you enjoy the soccer and get the opportunity to watch Glory play here definitely go along and participate. We had a lot of fun.
15;A Memorable Experience;It was a wet, cold and windy winters night when we attended the Western Force v Samoa game at NIB Stadium in July 2018, the first time we have been at the venue. The stadium is easily accessible by public transport (nearest rail station is Claisebrook) and there is on street parking around the venue.The security staff were excellent and helpful in this appalling weather - even the commentator was urging patrons to head for the overed East Stand to get out of the rain. Both teams played a great running game in such horrible conditions, the pitch was still in good condition after the match. The numerous toilets located around the stadium were kept clean and easily accessible. The entertainment, atmosphere and camaraderie at the venue was memorable - it's not a large stadium but would put a lot of larger stadiums to shame. Lots of outlets to grab a bite and drink inside the stadium. A great place for the family to visit and be entertained! Being close to Northbridge and Perth City you an have a meal & drink before (and after!) the game. We will be back!
15;Awesome Experience;We visited NIB Stadium for the Western Force vs Melbourne Rebels rugby game and I was blown away by how awesome the stadium is. Although small and compact, the atmosphere is epic and the facilities are amazing. We bought standing tickets in the Shed which were great and I won't buy any others in the future as there are toilets, bars and food close by. All in all, an awesome experience!
15;Lucky Mascots for Perth Glory;We went here for a soccer match between Perth Glory and Sydney Wanderers. We must be lucky mascots as Perth won for the first time in 6 matches. The standard of football isn't that great but the venue itself is good and the atmosphere was great. Nice to sit in the sun and have a couple of beers watching the game. There was a womens match on right after the mens match but unfortunately we couldn't stay for that.
15;Eat and drink before you go!;went to a music concert here yesterday. Venue itself OK. Plenty of toilets and viewing etc is good. Unfortunately it could have been the best stadium in the world but the smile quickly gets wiped off your face when you pay $41 for 4 small bottles of water and 3 buckets of chips! Absolute rip off!
16;Great for train enthusiasts;Only open on a Wednesday and Sunday afternoon but a great experience for our 5 year old grandson and grandad. Very well set out with plenty to see. It’s a shame that it isn’t open longer but as it’s run by volunteers it’s understandable.
16;Well Presented Hands On Exhibition;I have lived only a mile or so from the museum for years, but it has been while since my last visit, and the first time I have written a review. There is a lot to see with the museum having the largest collection of heritage steam engines, diesels, rolling stock, and other railwayania in Western Australia. Many of the steam and diesel locomotives are available to climb onboard the footplate, get a driver's view and imagine the power these engines had. Then have a walk through a variety of interesting rolling stock including sleeping, buffet, gold bullion transport, and shower cars. One in particular is the 1951 Vice Regal Coach with its luxury fittings built for Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mothers' visit to Perth in 1953. The museum is also home to the West Australian Model Railway Society, which have their trains running when the museum is open, they also have a snacks, cool drinks and ice creams available. As of writing the museum is open Wednesday's and Sundays between 1pm and 4pm, and there are extended times during school holidays. For prices, full details, and contacts see their Website, just google West Australia Heritage Transport Museum Bassendean WA.
16;Plenty to see on the Family Fun Day Sunday;Sunday 11 October was a special day with more than the usual exhibits of old steam locomotives and dining cars. There were stalls selling books and back copies of magazines on railways and model railways, plus a wood turning demonstration, plus a Thomas the Tank Engine bouncy castle for the kids. The WA Model Railway Club put their model train layout on display. And there was a sausage sizzle going as well. All in all, a great family day out.
16;Brilliant for young and not so young;I visited with my parents and my 5 year old son. We first had a very interesting chat with one of the volunteers who was acting as a guide before moving on to investigate the museum. My son loved being allowed to go on the various sizes and types of trains and carriages and was particularly impressed to meet Thomas the Tank Engine, so much so we had to bribe him to leave! This is such an underrated attraction, I firmly recommend a visit when you visit Perth.
16;Excellent way to entertain little ones and learn some history!;We had three generations of us attend The Railway Museum and what an adventure! The hands on ( climb in and on) nature of some of the exhibits kept the little ones interested - even making up their own little adventure stories as we wandered around all of the trains and paraphernalia. My mum who is a massive train lover was also transfixed at the history and tactile nature of it all. A really affordable, interested and slightly quirky way to spend an afternoon ( or morning ) in Bassendean. Super handy location, less than fifteen minutes from the CBD by car and with- of course- a super convenient train station right nearby. Due to the nature of the exhibits and the age of some of it, accessibility could be an issue for some but the team there are super accomodating and I’m sure would do what they could to assist. Definitely recommend
16;A pleasant surprise;Visited the Railway Museum with our daughter and her two small children, the elder child loving everything “train”. I only went along initially to help with the younger child but was pleasantly surprised at how much I thoroughly enjoyed our two and a half hours at the museum. The museum has something for both young and old. I found it all extremely interesting. There are old steam and diesel locomotives and carriages that you can access. Our older grandson thought he had died and gone to heaven! For me, I found the historic photographs and railway memorabilia of great interest. Our younger granddaughter squealed with delight watching the miniature trains. All in all, it was a very enjoyable experience. Even if you are not a train buff you will enjoy this museum. I would like to commend all the volunteers who make this museum possible. I would also like to commend the museum for the affordable entrance fee not only for pensioners but for families.
16;Railway Museum - Open Day - 2019;The museum premises appeared well-maintained with the bulk of the exhibits under cover. A good selection of old steam, diesel locomotives, carriage and special goods stock formerly use by the West Australian Government Railways was on display with safe access to some of them. Maintenance of the exhibits was good with evidence of work in progress. A considerable range of interesting railway ephemera, memorabilia, historic photographs and pictures was exhibited. Signage throughout was adequate and informative. The entire operation is a credit to the loyal and industrious group of volunteers whose enthusiasm for maintaining this aspect of Western Australia's history deserves to be applauded. The weather was fine on the Open Day (06/10/2019) which was well attended with a large number of young children adding a festive atmosphere, itself a pleasant experience. Many thanks to the museum staff for making the overall visit a pleasure. The museum deserves a wide public support.
16;Thanks for the memories and history;It is fantastic that a dedicated group of volunteers keep the history of Western Australia Government Railways alive with this magnificent collection of older locomotives and carriages. The old Australind, the Royal Carriage, sleeper carriages and many many engines make this a most interesting place to visit on a Sunday afternoon. Recommended fof anyone with an interest in trains. Children will have a great time climbing aboard.
16;Great for young or old;Even if your not a train buff, this is a great place to have a look around. The kids love trains and the parents have enough to keep us occupied while you walk around, it was great seeing the old trains from when I was a kid.
16;Interesting history of rail;This is a very interesting place to visit to see the details of a bygone era when train travel was very widespread.
16;Great day out for young and old!;We visited here on a family outing recently and had a great time – you don’t have to be an enthusiast to enjoy it! Opening times are limited but then it is volunteer run. It is a great days outing and for a small fee entrance as well. The blokes at the desk were super friendly and helpful. I honestly didn’t expect to see so many huge steam engines and carriages and all so well preserved too, those involved have done such a great job
17;;Nice after renovations has all the facilities needed good place to watch the regional train come in
17;;Walked to Optus stadium from East Perth train station. View was not bad.
17;;Clean, well maintained toilet facilities, open reasonable hours. Terminal departure lounge has good info and plenty of seating, open reasonable hours. Basic newsagent and cafe in the terminal. Friendly service and security staff Easy access through to both sides of East Perth. Passenger support available.
17;;Nice morning tea before boarding the Indian Pacific

17;;My trip great, there is always parking space at East Perth train station and it's cheaper
17;;Staff helpful and polite beautiful station
17;;4 hour parking limit Monday to Friday 7:30am to 5:30pm
17;;Lovely terminal, nice and big and clean, easy to board road coaches, the MerredinLink, the prospector and the Indian pacific. I really like the locomotive there too.
17;;Putting the address of the East Perth Station as simply Perth WA is the most confusing, rubbishy location possible. Nothing I've found on Google after half an hour's search gives me any clue of the relative distance between this terminal and the bus depot. Everything useless and tweetypie is available but nothing tangible that answers WHERE IS IT!!!
17;;Handy short term parking for a quick train ride into CBD. Stops are alternate time schedule stops.
18;Nice;I visisted this place early in the morning, before the sunrise, the view just amazing. I took nice photos here.
18;Central hub of the city;A must do when visiting Perth as it provides some great perspectives of the city. The Quay area has a nice vibe (busy, but not too busy) with easy access to public transport - buses, trains and ferries.
18;The key to the city;Elizabeth Quay is a great place to meet. You can access the ferry to the Zoo. King’s Park is just a short walk away
18;Modern Development;We enjoyed our couple of visits to the Quay during our stay in Perth. We had a great view of the Quay coming back into dock after a day at Rottnest Island. In the late afternoon sun, the buildings and surrounding areas looked stunning. They have certainly done an excellent job of revitalising this part of Perth.
18;Buzzing part of Perth;Wow, this part of Perth has really come on over the years and offers a great choice of dining and drinking options, as well as being a top part of a riverfront walk
18;great location;A stunning area, plenty of seating, to just sit and contemplate the lovely view, quite a few eating establishments
18;Great place;Loved walking to the quay, plenty to see and some lovely bars and restaurants. Some amazing architecture and a lovely place to sit
18;Lovely Sand Sculptures;We visited Elizabeth Quay during the holiday season on a warm Sunday evening. It was filled with families with small children enjoying traditional carnival rides and nostalgic games from the 1950s and 1960s. It was like stepping back in time. One of the most impressive sites were the beautiful sand sculptures of the season.
18;Nov 22;Disappointing at this stage with construction still unerway. Interesting sand scuulptures and the pub on the "Island" offered quick service, althugh the waiter had some difficulty working out the change until I told the answer
18;Nothing too extraordinary;There is a lot of fanfare about it. They are a few restaurants with nice views, and the ferries goes from there, but it is not a spectacular thing to go. The views are nice.
19;;Great Busport, feels like an airport terminal. Upto date bus depart time. Helpful Transperth staff . Clean and easy to get to the right gate. Also a  Kiosk to buy some food and drinks
19;;Ian ,at the Information centre ,on Busport’s Upper level, is a true customer service professional. A pleasure to deal with, and with a smile that’s worth a million dollars! Well done, Ian!!!
20;;Modern bus port, only one of its kind in Australia, much like some of the bus ports overseas. Buses pretty much run to the North in Perth from her.
20;;Good palace
21;Would never visit ever again.;Horrendous visit! Got told no entry with a valid British driving licence and needed a passport. Pathetic. Then watched another customer debate with the security as he didn’t hold the above and they ended up letting him go through. Complete breach of the Australian law. Visited America, Asia, Europe and other parts of Australia and never needed to show passport!
21;Great until bar not accepting cash;Didn’t accept cash - legal tender - at the theatre bar. I assume this would be the same at other places around casino. I boycott places that are “card only”. We do not want a cashless society like China with credit scores etc.
21;Don't waste your money;Such an awful place to visit. Got refused entry to the casino after specifically spending $500 on hotel to see this place. The security said my 65 year old dad was intoxicated which was a complete lie as we had not even been drinking. When we escalated the security supervisor was even more stupid. After reading reviews the security have a reputation for singling anyone they choose out not to enter and are all on thier own little power trip I will never spend a penny at this hotel again, and will recommend as a corporate customer to my company to advise against our employees from sponsoring this charade of a place.
21;What tha!!!;Accommodation great! Very clean serviced every day Not at all happy about being asked to leave the casino on the grounds of being intoxicated. Surrounded by thugs and asked many personal questions, felt very uncomfortable and interrogated.  Have heard similar stories from others. Keep this in mind when visiting Western Australia
21;So sad;Train all staff including management on importance of customer service, this hotel will survive because of the casino , so sad because it could be a wonderful family experience, the attitude of most of the staff reflects the managements complacency, so many senior people standing round in groups while service staff struggle to understand the meaning of customer service, I could give you many examples from our short stay , which says it all !! Great comfortable clean rooms , food could be so much better
21;Complaint Ignored;After such an awful experience with our three-night New Year's Eve stay and a complaint to Crown Towers, I have not had any form of response to my very detailed complaint. After a visit to the Ritz Carlton, boasting outstanding customer service, we gladly booked our usual Crown Towers New Year's three-night stay at Ritz Carlton for 2023 today. Due to incompetency, we do not rate or recommend Crown Towers for customer service, food, security staff, or restaurant venues within the complex.
21;Marred by a bad experience;A much needed getaway, I travelled solo to Perth for the New Year’s Eve weekend and stayed at Crown Perth. The first day was perfect - the Metropol hotel was magnificent (both room and pool area were sensational), and I spent my first evening in the casino wearing my casual walking shorts and tshirt after a beautiful 30 degree day. Had a great meal ‘88 noodle bar’, had a little trouble with my crown card (which was issued at crown Melbourne) but the magnificent staff helped me and fixed my card, and I had an enjoyable evening in the gaming area. It was all going so well! So the second night (New Years Eve), after a day out and about sightseeing in the city of Perth, I arrived back at the casino and intended to go in to have another nice meal at the 88 noodle bar before joining the new years festivities. This time I was unexpectedly stopped by security at the entrance, with the guard pointing to my shorts and saying ‘sports shorts are not allowed, especially tonight - so you must go and change’. Firstly, I saw this written nowhere, and all I had was shorts - I was only in Perth for 3 days, and each day was 30 degrees. Secondly, I saw numerous other people in the casino wearing shorts. And thirdly, I was in the casino the previous evening wearing the EXACT same shorts on with no issue at all. When I pointed this out (especially gesturing to the other patrons wearing shorts) I was tolled they were ‘dress shorts’ and mine were ‘sports shorts’ (to be honest, there was no real difference). Not to make a fuss with the guard, I simply walked around to another entrance. Once there I was immediately stopped again - obviously the cameras got me as being refused entry and I was flagged. This second guard was even ruder ‘you have been denied entry to crown and it will last for 24 hours!’, and when I asked ‘is it because I tried to get in with shorts when there are dozens of people already inside that are also wearing shorts?’ the response was ‘YOU ARE INTOXICATED!’ What? I was quite offended by that. I had no drinks at all, and all I wanted to do was enter the casino like I did the previous day and have a nice meal. I started to argue the point and offered to be breath tested but I could see it was to be to no avail (all the while people right next to me were still entering wearing shorts). I did not want to make an issue anymore, but unfortunately this was enough to ruin my night. I went back up to my room, showered, went to the external food court and then outside to watch the NYE fireworks, but the attitude of the security guards really marred my evening. All I wanted to do was go inside the gaming complex to have a nice meal before the fireworks! Now I can understand a dress code - no thongs/singlets/ripped clothes or offensive slogans. But nowhere have I seen it written that simple walking shorts are not allowed (especially on a 30 degree day and especially when so many others are wearing shorts inside with no issues, including myself the previous night). But basically this was a guard that had his own opinion and wanted a bit of a power trip, which was enough to flag me for the entire night (I guess it pretty much depends who you get, it probably wouldn’t have been an issue with other guards) - but I guarantee this wouldn’t have been a problem at all at Crown Melbourne, where they are more welcoming. I can understand if it WAS a strict dress code and they stopped OTHER people wearing shorts as well (this wouldn’t have been a problem) - but to single me out while others could AND falsely accuse me of being ‘intoxicated’ (must be the code word for denied entry) - it was a disappointing ending to an otherwise pleasant weekend in Perth.
21;Average;The crown has some good events on, the sports bar is great and the live bands every weekend. However, their dress code states that you can't wear casual attire during the day, including shorts or thongs... In 30-40degree heat, yet they along track pants and hoodies to be worn through the night that I have seen on many occasions. I'll keep my money thanks
21;Very clean;Have been a couple of times recently. Staff are friendly and helpful, tables and toilets are clean. Pity some of the customers with coughs don't stay home or wear masks.
21;Ridiculous;The first time I went there it was smooth. 2nd time I went there was ID check so I produced my National ID but this lady security guard insisted that they only accept passport as proof. Ridiculous. We are in our 30s, way past the age limit. And why is National ID not a proper form of proof? It’s accepted in Crown Melbourne. This casino is a joke.
22;Excellent Customer Service;Big thank you to the lady staff member on duty in the balcony at the Mike & The Mechanics concert last night (Sunday 16th 2023) The balcony seats were the only ones we could buy. We didn't realise how steep the access stairs were or how narrow the seat rows were. . My husband, who uses walking sticks, found getting to his seat difficult and leg room insufficient. We mentioned this to the lady staff member who kindly found us seats in the stalls . Thanks also to the gentleman member of staff downstairs who guided us to our new seats. Excellent customer service--and the concert was great too.!
22;Great Staff, great show - shame about the food!;The booking staff are wonderful, helpful and friendly. I hold an ACROD pass and was given a parking space at the front. All was going well, I probably should have phoned them first, as I expected the restaurants would be open! My husband and I arrived at 6.00pm in my wheelchair, we tried in vain to find an entrance open, anyway, a very nice lady opened a door for us and asked us to come inside and relax before the doors officially opened, she told us the main restaurant wasn't open ok but we expected the other one to be as she hadn't said anything about it.
22;OK Show. Shame about the venue.;Visited the concert hall today to watch a version of The Nutcracker with my 8 Yr old granddaughter. Not a full ballet company ensemble, most of the Corp de Ballet made up of children from local ballet schools. This meant dancing & formations were a bit ropey most of the time but what I could see was enjoyable because of their joy de vie. The big phrase here is what I could see. Was seated in the upper gallery and the view from our seats and probably 3/4 of other seats there was severely restricted with maybe just about half the stage visible. On the booking and ticket there was no indication that this restriction existed. Whilst the ticket price was reasonable probably due to it being a largely amateur show you were still paying the same amount as those with full viewing. Really disappointed with the design. If those were the only seats available for a professional show I would avoid the place like the plague.
22;Amazing Staff at Perth Concert Hall;I am a support worker for Ability WA. Today, myself and some colleagues took our clients to attend the most amazing concert at The Perth Concert Hall. The musicians were absolutely magical, could have listened to them all day. They took the time to have a delicious morning tea and a chat with us afterwards. This was provided to us free of charge by the concert hall. What made the day most amazing was the customer service provided by the staff. They were absolutely amazing. I met Keith as I entered the front door and he went over and beyond to help me out. He is the most kindest, helpful soul. And there was a number of female staff who couldn't do enough for us. (I forget their names. Overall, We had the best day and I cannot speak more highly of you guys. Well done! We will be back. (If you have us ha )
22;Long wait for the people of Perth was worthwhile;
22;Birds of Tokyo;I have been to the Concert Hall many times as the guest of my mother, who had a subscription to the West Australian Symphony Orchestra (WASO) concert series. I must say the Concert Hall is a magnificent venue for classical and contemporary music. Before 1973, when the Concert Hall opened, WASO played in less suitable venues. Despite the years of wrangling between various levels of government, the end result was this first-class building, which is said to have some of the best acoustics in Australia.. The building's architecture, restrained Brutalism in off-white concrete, only adds to its charm. The Concert Hall can hold 1,729 concertgoers, plus 160 choristers.
22;WASO Beethoven - The Emporer;Went to see Birds of Tokyo with The Western Australian Symphony Orchestra, great night and fantastic atmosphere. Everyone was amazing.
22;Restrained Brutalism makes for a striking building;Best concert in long time. Seriously good both the Beethoven and the Brahms. Seems the WASO players have been itching to get back into it. Giving a stellar performance.
22;Amazing Acoustics and seatings;Was there for a concert with Szeps-Znaider as a special guest. The concert hall had amazing acoustics and as a tourist below 30, i was allowed to purchase the subsidised pricing from WASO, just bring along passport to verify!
22;Pride of Perth's music buffs;The Perth Concert Hall is the pride and joy of Perth's music lovers. It was designed for classical music, a function it performs admirably. It is the home base for WASO -- the Western Australian Symphony Orchestra. To get an annual subscription to the WASO series with a good seat you may have to wait for someone to drop off the twig. Parking is convenient and ample refreshments can be purchased.
23;Rip off event parking;
23;RAC;We went to Michael McIntyre last night , personally it’s to big of a venue for 1 man show , the seats are tiny no leg room , the sound you can hardly hear .
23;Great location;This is a great venue for concerts and the location is the best. Located in the Perth CBD with good transport .\
23;Sardine;What's up with the seating situation at RAC Arena? Did they forget to put back in the adult sized chairs after the last Wiggles concert? You sit cheek to mushed-together cheek and must orientate your shoulders interlocking domino style just to give you and your two new found butt buddies a BIT more freedom.
23;Great sound, love the blue;I think the sound is great in the place, loved the blue. Somehow it works. Not very good facilities or food and drink venues inside.
23;Modern well-located venue;Great arena. Fabulous acoustics. Very comfortable seating with drink holders and armrests. Adequate drink outlets and toilets for a 15000 seat venue.
23;Terribly Managed;I don’t understand when you go for a show that the are constantly unable to cater for the crowds It’s so expensive and you are paying for crap food and drinks that are terrible Why can’t you just buy vodka that doesn’t have flowers in it Why do you run out before the interval
23;Great place to see the Wildcats;Basketball is very popular is Western Australia (WA) and the Perth Wildcats regularly draw big crowds. The stadium can hold 15,000 spectators -- that's big for a basketball game. The RAC Arena was formerly called the Perth Arena. RAC stands for Royal Automobile Club, a not-for-profit organisation that provides services for WA motorists. It's a great stadium, less then 10 years old. It's in Wellington Street, a medium walk from the centre of Perth. Just look for a large, futuristic building. If you are an RAC member, flash your card and you can skip the queue.
23;Great Arena;It seems that all seats have great views too! Really enjoyed the tour - it is lit up at night and looks like a space ship ready to take off! Stayed across the street at the Four Points Sheraton - great view of the arena!
23;Beautiful accessible facility!;It seems that all seats have great views too! Really enjoyed the tour - it is lit up at night and looks like a space ship ready to take off! Stayed across the street at the Four Points Sheraton - great view of the arena!
24;Good netted swimming beach with good change room facilities. Sculpture on the Beach was a bonus.;Our first visit to Cottesloe Beach and found that they were hosting Sculpture on the Beach. Very interesting and entertaining. Excellent sandy beach with a large netted area for swimming that allowed the waves through. Good change room facilities and cafe.
24;Wonderful Australian Beach and Area;Nothing much to say other than a wonderful beach and area. I love Cottesloe Beach and all the surrounding area!! Love the fact that there are many places, to eat, toilets and showers to use after swimming, as well as lawned areas if you want to picnic too. The water is always so beautiful to swim in at Cottesloe Beach, love it!! The only downside can be parking as it gets really busy, particularly on weekends, other than that I highly recommend Cottesloe Beach! (BTW my photos don't do it justice).
24;Another beach;Another beach - they are all the same and suited our aims - sun tan and swimming. Once again, it was busy.
24;Awesome place, good parking lots, wasn’t summer yet but people was allover the place, some extremely fancy restaurants;Nice a fancy restaurant but also good an convenient corner shops were to have quick and low price lunchs, lot of safety.. beautiful place
24;Perfect;This is a lovely beach, and it the favourite for Perth residents I would guess. It goes on for quite a bit. People walk, run and cycle it. There a several cafe's and restaurants. It is nonetheless, very calm and quite. It has a big retirement community. We were there for almost a week, in an AirBnB, and used it as our base to discover Perth and its surroundings.
24;Makes a nice day trip from Perth;Very interesting and pleasurable place to visit from Perth. It is clearly quite an upmarket residential area with many fine properties of varying architectural styles and ages.
24;Parking Sucks. Enforcement Nazis;Happy to employ staff to dispense parking fines 24 seven but when you want to contact them they leave a message we are not available thank you Cottesloe for your parking fine even though there were plenty of parks and quiet on the street it was a Sunday thank you enjoy your week. Pissed off visitor. Parking sucks.
24;Sandy coastline;Were here in July not swimming weather but plenty of surfers out enjoying the small waves. Popular walking track above the beach for all to use. Beautiful sunsets and sunrises t be seen.
24;A must visit;A beautiful protected beach north of Fremantle Nearby parking, restaurants, pub & cafes are all good. The lawn areas overlooking the ocean are great for picnics & or relaxing in the shade. Plenty of space even on the busy days. A shark prevention net is in place at the main beach section near the rock wall (groyne) Slip Slop Slap Slide & enjoy
24;Sand & Scenery;My wife wished to visit the area where she spent her younger days so we headed to Cottesloe and areas adjacent. Very nice beach area, the scantily clad enjoying 19c temperatures, clean sand and a calm ocean. Nice park areas.
