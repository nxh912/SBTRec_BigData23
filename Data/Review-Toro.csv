1;Hmmmm;So this is the epicenter of pro hockey, the arena was odd lets just say.  There are only two big decks so you would think the concourses would be wide, not the case, you are really crammed in there.  I did get a foot long hot dog and a nice blend of peppers was available at the condiment bar so that was good.  Beer prices are what they are at pro venues so there is no point in complaining about that.  We sat in the upper deck under an overhang of luxury suites that hang down from the roof which didnt hamper our view of the ice but it made it so you couldnt sit there and see the whole arena, also the sections are wide so there will be up to 30 seats in a row.  This place is OK but for it being the arena for THE team in Canada it was kind of a disappointment.  On a positive note it is literally connected to the downtown commuter, long distance and  subway trains station so you dont even need to drive there, the GO train in from Oakville took about 40 mins.
1;Go Raptors!;This was our first time , we were here to watch the Raptors play. The arena had a great selection of food, it was easy to navigate the arena. Overall we had a great time watching the game.
1;Almost a 1/2 hour wait to use Restroom;The game was great. A 25 minute wait to use a restroom is inappropriate.  Also the restrooms are not clean due to the usage. If there was a fire, it is hard to believe that this facility meets safety obligations. The price of snacks and alcohol is price gouging. Otherwise the environment is great!
1;What a game!;My second time here in 6 months. I was here in November for the Legends game for Daniel Alfredsson’s Hall of Fame induction. That time was perfect.<br>This time was for my first Raptors game. My son and I had a great time. We were in section 323 in the last row. Yes it is far up there. I tried to change my tickets because I received an email from the Raptors on game day that new tickets were released. When contacting Ticketmaster , it could not be done due to 24 hour time frame. So confused, as I was willing to pay an extra 600 dollars for the upgrade. Not to mention once the game started there was so many empty seats in the 100 level.<br>During the game way too many people were lost and blocking the aisle and ruining our view from the last row in 323. No staff said anything until the end of the game when we were told to leave shortly after the game ended. Not to mention upon arrival for the game at gate 1 there was an employee screaming at everyone with a microphone to go up the stairs to another line.<br>Overall we had a great time during the game. There was a tv on the wall to see game moments.<br>I downloaded the Raptors app to have some food delivered to our seat. That was awesome and quick!<br>The show and game was incredible! Food service and merchandise shop staff were awesome too!<br>Go Raptors!
1;Birthday Game!!;Good place to watch Hockey. Lots of drink and food options. Went for Birthday. Too bad they didn't have my name on the jumbotron as requested.
1;GO RAPTORS and GO MAPLE LEAFS.;I've always dreamed of going to see either a Raptors game or a Leafs game. I really like to how awesome this place looks. Nothing to dislike about this place.
1;A good venue;I've been to both sporting and concert events and was pleased with both.  As expected it's very expensive,  Save it for something you really want to see.
1;Huge place;Saw a performance by the Eagles.  LOTS and LOTS of people.  Very crowded.  Kind of narrow seats. Nice to have a drink holder at each seat.
1;Delayed entry - missed part of concert;Re: Eagles Concert Sept 10, 2022<br><br>Scotiabank Arena reassigned seats / tickets, ON THE SPOT, JUST PRIOR TO ENTRY, for a very large group of audience. This caused a severe congestion, and entry to the arena was delayed for many, many people.<br><br>At no fault of our own, we were forced to miss the first 2 songs, including Hotel California.<br><br>Appalling and disappointing experience. Good band, bad venue.
1;Terrible sound in 300 sections;Attended Due Lipa's concert today and was disappointed with the sound quality here. It's like the speakers weren't working in this section at all, didn't really "feel" the music and couldn't understand much of her vocals either.
1;Good to see concert, not great to get service;The venue is great to hear and/see a concert.  The line ups to get served are extremely long and take most of the events time to get served.  During event many of the serving stations are not open.
1;great building;seen a few hockey games and some concerts.  This is a great building to watch concerts and Games.  again beer is expensive here plus some places have a admin fee which you don't catch  plus if you tip you end up tipping twice.
2;Football (soccer) Stadium - Location, Location, Location!!!;Getting a “free” ticket for a seat related to my Atlanta United FC season tickets, did not allow me to choose the seat.  Consequently I was on the last row (highest) on the second level.  It was a very long walk up a lot of steps.  Not for the faint hearted.  The view of the field was good, but related to the position I was in, it was difficult to see the big screen to see close ups of the action.  I would not pay for that seat for a future match.  The atmosphere was very good however, food choices were fair, but expensive - although all stadium food is expensive related to what I am used to in my home stadium in Atlanta.  Service was quick, lines not too long at all.  Unusual way to enter the stadium, that even after going through security was still behind a closed gate for a while.  Location is absolutely perfect.  Beautiful view right on the water’s front.  Great park and walking area just across from the stadium if you have spare time when going to an event.
2;Great Staff!;We mostly do concerts here but the sports venue is good too. Excellent handicap seating and lots of good places to grab food and beverage of choice,  When it is full it is really really loud so you might consider ear phones or plugs,<br>P:arking is a bit of a challenge so see if there is somewhere ck to park and take a cob over,
2;Pretty average;Just a simple round Stadium with a few food stands. The seats aren't the most comfortable, felt like bleacher seats. It was hard to see the score board depending on your seats.
2;Only half made it in by start and staff inadequate and uncaring;Lines hundreds of meters long - some pushed in in 15 or 20 min others took more than 90 minutes. Many only got in at half time<br><br>Security tried to expedite but MSLE ticket checkers help people up and were uncaring
2;Good venue;Great arena,  pricey drinks as usual at any sporting event,  clean environment,  had some nice kids game giveaway thingies,  pretty big place
2;Nice Venue, Sit on the West Side;We went as a family to see TFC play for the first time for their finale against the Columbus Crew. The seats we got were situated right in the corner, a few rows up, on the east side. As an evening game, the sun was setting and it was right in our eyes for a lot of the first half - therefore, sit on the west side!<br><br>The atmosphere was great. Toronto has a great supporters section and some amazing camaraderie and atmosphere.The food was as expected, expensive stadium food, so, nothing out of the ordinary. The stadium doesn't feel huge, so there aren't really any bad seats. My kids got a kick out of seeing all of the airplanes taking off from Toronto Billy Bishop Airport.<br><br>BMO Field was accessible by both GO Train and by the TTC streetcars. There were ample streetcars waiting after the game to take everyone to Union Station and home from there.
2;To see Toronto FC against Chicago with Sebastian Schweinsteiger.;Every seat in the stadium has good view. Foot is good but a bit expensive. Parking very convenient and reasonable priced
2;Great stadium;Went to the Toronto FC vs. Minnesota United game.  This was our first professional soccer game (we were visiting from MA.)  The stadium is great and the fans were awesome.  Getting into the stadium is a bit slow.  Only complaint is that the 200 level seats didn't have cup holders.
2;Worst professional stadium in North America;Countless issues with untrained security. Lousy security, lousy ushers, overpriced merch, food and beer. I gave up my season tickets after 9 years, and never spent a dime to support any MLSE team since.  I had a good laugh at their expansion and new "roof".  $200 million wasted.  Good riddance.
2;Nice atmosphere and sightlines.;A few min walk from the streetcar stop, great sight lines and overall fun experience for TFC Soccer.
2;Great stadium, even better fans!;Attended the Toronto vs Atlanta MLS match, which happily was a 4-1 win for TFC! Lovely stadium with great views no matter where you sit. Last game of the season which probably contributed to the awesome atmosphere.
2;Cool Stadium;Good location, Nice stadium and fun atmosphere. I enjoyed my time at the game and tickets are usually real cheap.
3;Great spot;Amazing facility. Great to stroll around and check out goods. Maple and bacon doughnuts are a revelation. The artwork made of old seats is really clever.
3;I’m glad it’s still there.;It’s not been a place for hockey for nearly 20 years or maybe longer but I’m glad it wasn’t torn down. The building was converted into a Loblaws grocery store (you can see Center ice in aisle 25) and as part of Ryerson University. Not much changed except the price of food. Inflation is insane right now.
3;Great Experience;If you are a hockey fan it would be worth a trip to visit a Leaf's game.  I happened to be in Toronto on work when I discovered the Blues were in town to play the Leafs.  It's one of those old time stadiums with very steep stairs.  But great site lines.  It was a Monday night and there was standing room only. They've done a cool thing by making a standing room only section behind the very top row and it was packed.  With a subway attached to the stadium it's amazing how many people you can move out of the area quickly. Fans appeared to be relatively nice to the visiting blues fans.  This was a nice surprised compared to other stadiums such as Chicago, Boston, etc.
3;Canadian Blind Hockey Nationals;What a beautiful piece of history being kept alive. Loved seeing all the Maple Leaf pictures around the building. My little boy was pretty excited to play hockey in the same building the Leafs once did. Not many little guys from Newfoundland can say they did that. Amazing memories made especially having Wendel Clark and Doug Gilmore come and drop the puck for the Select teams. That was the cherry on the cake. Stories and memories that will last a life time made during our tournament!!
3;Lovely building!;I just wanted to visit the old girl!  I am a Leafs fan from the UK and have only seen this building from the outside.  I was looking at the Ryerson Uni website and found out that you can do a self guided tour of the building!!  I save the PDF to my laptop, but on the day forgot to print it out.  I went to the reception and the guy behind kindly printed it out for me.  I found that the building seemed to have a presence.  Looking at all the photos and clips of history on the walls it felt weird.  I was asked to stop recording the basketball team that was practising in the court. Ooops!! If I had more time I would of taken my time to walk a bit more slowly and take it in!  I will be back I'm sure!!
3;Now part of Ryerson University;Walked around here and was amazed that Ryerson has purchased or leased maple leaf gardens. It doesn't look like they have done much to change things, it still has an old world charm to it.
3;Great Old Original 6 Barn;You can still feel the blue and white history oozing from the walls of this old majestic palace.  Now a LCBO and Loblaws Grocery store , but still quite accessible.  Many historical markings throughout, such as centre ice and concert postings (such as the Beatles) throughout.  Met Doug Gilmour last week in Loblaws at his book signing, so you never know who you'll see there.
3;Trveled here a few times during y sons Hockey career;Exciting place with a lot of history. After closing my account by mistake, I am recreating my account and experiences
3;Love the old Gardens;It's wonderful they still use the old gardens    We love this place. The Loblaws is amazing with the cheese wall and ACE bakery. We never miss the opportunity to visit when in Toronto.
3;Although repurposed, still has a lot of history;Maple Leaf Gardens is now home to the Mattamy Athletic Centre and Loblaws.   Still a lot of history to be found inside and worth a visit if you're a fan of hockey history.
3;Mixed Emotions visiting The Gardens;I have not been at the Gardens since one of the last Leaf games.  I drove by it many times and it was kind of sad to see this old building just stand there seemingly lonely and empty.  I know its been "re-purposed" and its home of the Ryerson team as well as a loblaws and a community centre, but I just did not want to admit that the Maple Leaf Gardens are no more.  So... I was walking past it couple days ago, and I decided to go in... walked right in through the main entrance and all kinds of emotions came on, it was very weird.... I was able to walk all around the new gym and right into the rink.  It was pretty awesome.. Standing there with the perfect sheet of ice and "THAT" ceiling above you .... almost as it was so long ago... I had no idea what a great job they did preserving the feel of the Gardens.... and you can just walk in off the street and walk right in and reminisce.. ...  I'm so glad I did that... I will have to come back to watch a live hockey game at this place... if you have not seen this place, walk in, check it out.  it will bring back some memories.
3;Great place;Visited Loblaws Maple Leaf Gardens one of the best supermarkets I have ever been to. They make fresh bread daily in the Ace bakery, amazing meals made fresh everyday in the kitchen. Such a great store to visit right in the heart of Toronto's downtown, a must see for foody's and hockey fans
4;Affordable day with the family;Watched a Blue Jay game and our total over all experience was great! The concession stands were all well staffed and no major lineups. The changes that were made around the stadium allowed spectators to watch the game in a bar like setting. Once you’re in the stadium you’re allowed to experience these areas. If you’re not glued to the idea of a seat I recommend buy cheaper seats and walk around. Tuesdays $1 hotdogs!<br>Would say it’s one of the more affordable days I had with the family.<br><br>
4;Play Ball!!!!;Great stadium! When visiting, make sure u catch a game. I wouldn’t have done it any other way. One or two nights in town,  staying at the heart of it all definitely is the way to go.
4;Stadium with City Vibes;Really enjoyed attending two games at the Rogers Centre. Upgraded to the 200 level behind home plate for our first game. Great views to enjoy the game, with little more privacy due to being in the club. Loved that your could order poutine at the park. Had upper levels for our second game and would never sit there again. The steep climb to get up there combined with the sharp angle of seats gave me anxiety. The dome was open both games allowing us to enjoy the downtown skyline as well. Not a ton of memorable things to see within the park and souvenir options were limited, but it was a fun place to experience a game.
4;GO BLUE JAYS! The best place that I've ever been to;I really liked this place. My favorite team plays here. Nothing to dislike this place. I sometimes watch the Blue Jays on TV.
4;Opening Day April 2022;It was a fantastic experience…turned out to be a great game! Our first time there. We travelled from Alberta to see opening day and we’re not disappointed. Food, seats and staff are great. Would go again in heartbeat but we got inexpensive flights so it probably won’t happen again.  Never know!
4;nothing can beat it;it was great i went with a few friends we took a bus and went rogers centre we got hot dogs and popcorn one bad thing is it kind smells like smoke and under my chair there would be nuts but a got next level towel it was great time
4;Not worth it;Overpriced joke this place is.<br>In the sphincter of an awful city.<br>Traffic is unbelievable and horrendous.<br>Better off to stay in hotel and stream anything.
4;Blue Jays vs NY Yankees - great arena;Visited to watch the Blue Jays vs NY Yankees. <br>Fantastic state of the art and modern arena. <br>Better than any stadium I have been to in the UK. <br>Great atmosphere as well.
4;Only enjoyable for drunks;Took my dad out for his first baseball game. It was impossible to watch. We had drunks seat-jumping. Not much point in buying a good seat. My dad is a senior, the atmosphere was not what he was expecting. He said it took the magic out of baseball.
4;Well worth a visit!;First ever baseball game and loved it! Stadium is fantastic and when the roof opens WOW! what a view of the CN tower. The one thing I would say is the food and drinks are very expensive so I’d eat before I go there!
4;Rogers Centre Food very disappointing;The Game was amazing. Our seats in the 200 level also amazing. <br>The food was the worst experience. I’ve attended many ballparks around the majors. <br>Toronto is by far scoring the lowest<br><br>When you can’t even offer hot dogs with flavour your missing the mark. <br>The 200 level menu in the seats at the TD club is also embarrassing.  <br>How could you entertain clients with bad pizza chicken tenders and hot dog options <br><br>Really let’s fix this problem.
4;Wish They would have Won.;Went to a Jay's Game. As always the stadium was clean and tidy. The washrooms were great, food was good, drinks priced a little high, staff were helpful as always.
5;Learn more</span> about animal welfare in tourism;So much for the Sport of Kings.
5;Woodbine racetrack is now a low rent casino. The floor space dedicated to slots has increased so much  that previous vantage points for actually viewing the track is severely curtailed. The so-called "Champions bar" has no windows facing the track but a series of TVs and automated "wagering machines" that makes for a sad, and hollowed out cavern, designed to separate customers from their money in as fast a fashion as possible. Without the slightest interest in entertainment, cuisine or the majesty of the horses, Woodbine is now on my "must miss" list for things to do in Toronto.;Fun time at the races
5;We went for the first time in many years. The whole facility is fresh and offers much in the way of experiences.<br>We didn’t know where to eat so went to customer service desk. Laura suggested the patio, Stella Artois. She escorted us to the 3 rd level personally. We were lead to a table with full view of the tracks and it was on the finish line! Awesome view and comfortable seats. We ordered drinks and food which arrived promptly. <br>The food was tasty and portions were large. Our server was polite, professional and friendly.;RIP OFF RACE TRACK
5;Stay far away from Woodbine Race Track.  They are as crooked as a dogs hind leg.  They are impossible to handicap and  it shows in their average pay offs.  You would be better trying to  win money in their Casino.   DO NOT BET ON THEIR PONIES!;Dirty
5;The casino is okay but the choice of food and drink are pretty bad. The outside grounds are unbelievably dirty with cigarette butts everywhere.  I would expect more care to be taken. It nice that there is no smoking inside but clean up your property. I probably would not go back;Mums 70th birthday!
5;I can’t say enough about our wonderful day yesterday at Woodbine racetrack to celebrate my mom‘s 70th birthday. From the second I started making the reservation, everyone was so incredibly helpful in making this day so special. Vanessa was the person I was contacting back-and-forth about our reservation, and she could not do enough to make sure all 24 of us were seated together and in a way that made it accessible for my mom‘s wheelchair.    We had the perfect spot and after much moving around she was able to accommodate all of us on the same level side-by-side.  The waitress was great and even with all 7 little kids kept us happy and attended to through the whole 7 hours (sorry I can’t remember her name 😔)! <br><br>The other person I want to highlight is Jan, the lady who gave us the paddock tour, as well as the special gift of going to the announcers booth that my parents, aunt and uncle received as part of one of the birthday options. She was so friendly and so  helpful, giving us such an enjoyable experience. My mom really had the most wonderful time and it’s thanks to these ladies in particular for going over and above to make it perfect. We enjoyed it so much and even with the 7 kids lasted the whole day of racing and can’t wait to come back. We are already planning our next visit! Thank you for helping us create a beautiful day of memories! It’s the little things that make these events so special and these two added so many little touches through their kindness ❤️;Queen Plate not impressed
5;We love going to the track and betting on the horse.  Been to a couple of them this on it ok.  They have the casino and we went on the Queen Plate day which it the reason I think we didn’t like it.  It was get to dress up, take pictures and listen to music.  But it was so crowed.  Hard to find a spot to eat. Try to see the horse up close.  Lines were so slow for everything.  We couldn’t appreciate the experience.;Out for an evening of fun and gambling
5;<span>Learn more</span> about animal welfare in tourism;Very low class and rundown place
5;We live in Toronto and decided to check this place. Got there around 730/8pm, on a Saturday, the escalator was out of service and going up we could see that the escalator steps were quite dirty. The slot machine room was small and they had packed all the slot machine they could physically shove in that place, without taking into account any design. Everyone was super close to each other the floor was super old and dirty, some guy was going around offering free coffee,the coffees were premade and in foam cups with lids, I mean FOAM cups,really??, Costco business center sells 250 to 400 hot beverage cups for next to nothing something like 10 cents or less, you would think a casino for the money it makes can afford to buy some better cups.The staff offering water and coffee were dressed so cheap looking shirts and pants you would think they were janitors.<br>The food court was very limited and food quality very bad. The only semi decent restaurant in that building was closed.all in all if we ever decide to go to a casino this place would never be an option.The place was quite depressing and lacked any spark.;Review of 2019 Queen's Plate at Woodbine racetrack
5;I did find much review on the annual Queen's Plate racing event, so here's the review.<br><br>There are LOTS of people attending! Races began 12pm, and by 1:30pm we got there, we had to park very far away. You can valet park, there's line up but not tremendous, however wait until you want to leave between 6:30-7:30, the valet line is tremendous, waiting will be 30 minutes and more at the ground floor museum area.<br><br>A lot of people do dress up, guys with nice blazer and hat, ladies with pretty dresses and of course, fancy hats. It was a nice scene for Toronto, as it's usually laid back style. <br><br>There's men and women fashion contest, but the winners are not most fashionable for sure, it's just fun for participants. Man's winners gets cash, Women's winners get some fashion store gift card. <br><br>The building is packed! Every betting machine has average 6-people line up, food court has huge line up, it was a hot day, so even if you just want a soda, line up will be 15 minutes. Tip: 4th floor has no air-conditioning, and least line up for the soda!<br><br>After the main Queen's Plate race, the crowd gradually leave. There are concert at the grounds to attract people not to leave at the same time. <br><br>BTW, the building has free wifi. <br><br>In all, if you are ok with big crowd, you'll like the event.;Went with friends
5;We had reservations for 9 we were spit up into 3 tables.  We were given programs and water.  We went to the buffet, there was a nice selection of salads, meats and fish along with a selection of pickles and condiments.  There were 3 types of buns.  There was a breakfast bar where you could have waffles, or eggs etc.  The hot table had roast pork and roast beef here as potatoes, veggies, salmon and chicken. There was also a dessert table.  It was nice, but expensive for a buffet @ $49.95 + coffee and tea extra!!  When I settled my bill it was $60.00, plus the money I took to play the horse races, an expensive afternoon for sure!;Will not be returning to Woodbine racetrack Champions Lounge
5;Yesterday's "service" in the Champions Lounge was absolutely horrible - completely unacceptable.  There were seven of us.  After waiting about 15 mins. just to place our order for drinks and lunch, our server took our orders.  She was very vague about the menu ("yah..I think so")  were typical responses.<br><br>We then waited another 20 minutes (no exaggeration) to receive the drink order.  The server said the delay was because we ordered on-tap beer which took forever to get poured because the bartenders serve their favourite customers that are sitting at the bar first. lesson learned - order bottled beer.  <br><br>Our next round of drinks took another 15 minutes to arrive. <br><br>I don't know how this place can have such poor staff - they don't seem to care. <br><br>We observed our sever standing by the staff area, watching the TV screens (while we were still waiting for our orders). Yesterday's service was so bad it was almost funny. <br><br>Never again.  We are done with that place.  Which is a shame - we used to love going to the racetrack and having a nice lunch, with reasonably good service.;Enjoy This Outing For A Meal, Horse racing and Casino
5;I had the pleasure of visiting this establishment for the Mother's Day Weekend and enjoyed it again. The buffet lunch was a bit on the expensive side and could have had a few more food choices, but since it was more about the company than the meal we had a good time. What I like about this place is that you can enjoy the races while you are having a comfortable buffet meal and when you are done if you are so inclined, you can venture off to the casino. They have really enhanced this establishment since I last went. They now have 3 floors of casino play depending on what your interest is. It was a great day out overall and even though it seemed to have some construction going on in the main casino area, I still consider this place to be a "HIT" and would definitely go back again.;Spend an Afternoon in the Sun...
5;...watching a horse race or three.  A pleasant venue with comfortable enough seating.<br><br>I'd suggest you avoid the food court.  The flavors may be OK, but there's a pervasive odor of rancid Chinese food.  Like a late night walk past the cheapest joint in Chinatown just before they get ready to scrub down the kitchen.;Worst place ever
5;;
6;Decent size and varied collection, great building;The AGO was our first stop after arriving in Toronto. I'd researched in advance and jumped on the opportunity for free entry on Wednesday after 6pm. Worked perfectly with our arrival time and drive into the city.<br><br>There was parking at a garage just a block down, only $6 for < 2hrs. We walked in and saw a decent crowd of younger people signing up for the Under 25 annual pass. We walked up to the desk and signed in for our free, printed tickets and a paper map.<br><br>Much of the gallery is dominanted by the floor-to-ceiling wooden spiral staircase. We took it up to the fourth floor, later, but started on floor 2 to see indigenous art. Some great landscape pieces, some for sale in the gift shop as prints.<br><br>There was a bit more contemporary art than we liked, and one audio display room that sent a girl out of the room in distress. So we avoided that.<br><br>The lowest level has a large collection of cool ship models, tons of detail and the first floor has a decent European collection. Also really comfy couch-benches in there.
6;Family Day Visit;Group of us went on family day and were able to get a wheelchair for my mother.  We all really enjoyed the exhibits and will go again.  So much to see and well laid out.
6;Excellent permanent and temporary exhibitions;I went to see the wonderful Leonard Cohen exhibition, but stayed to see the excellent permanent exhibits, especially the Indigenous art collection.
6;Final destination for all art lovers!;Final destination for all art lovers! What a destination for those who love art! You can find the artistic brilliance and some awfulness too. It's a must!
6;Always Amazing;Every visit, every exhibition since I was a child, to now, an old lady, the AGO has been an amazing, provocative visual place for me.  It is a must see for locals and tourists.  I hope the AGO will continue to always have support and aid to remain a vital part of Toronto.
6;Just great;The quality of some exhibits is outstanding and we happily spent nearly two hours on the first floor and the lower ship exhibition. The entry process was simple and staff all friendly. Well-recommended,
6;Art across the centuries;In this gallery you can find an amazing collection of art across the centuries. Canadian fine art is represented here by the extensive Group of Seven collection. You can see the works of Pablo Picasso, Auguste Renoir, Edgar Degas or Peter Paul Rubens here, which is absolutely amazing.<br>The exhibition of historical ship models is also worth to visit.
6;if time worth a visit;if you know art, then likely a place to go, otherwise for the casual rainy day fan, worth stroll.  Buy tickets on line, line for tickets excessively long - their system/staff painfully slow. Think 25 and under get in free.
6;Excellent Gallery;A great collection for a big, diverse, sophisticated city. From european classics to heartwarming Canadiana (LOTS of Group of Seven here!), ancient old religious paintings from the 1200's, an amazing collection of miniatures, abstract art, modern, a pretty wonderful Henry Moore sculpture gallery space, it has lots to see and do. Bonus - the exterior/interior stairways on the south side, and extending into the Walker court from the top floor modern galleries, both have interesting views of the city - take a look!<br>Ps - the "espresso" bar in galleria Italia is expensive, and has poor espresso. Sadly, they get 1 star for drab, tasteless espresso. <br>What a missed opportunity!
6;Age 25 and under get in for FREE;Yes, AGO is encouraging young people ages 25 and under to visit for FREE every day of the week.<br><br>Adult is $25 per admission or $35 for an annual pass.<br><br>This is a very unique building.  The architecture is so neatly designed.  You must see it to believe it.<br><br>The exhibits are really cool, especially the Infinity Room by Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama.  When you get there, the staff will have you scan a code to go online to book a time to enter Kusama's room.  This room is so unique with many orbs.  This room is a must see.<br><br>Also the gallery's atrium is open for rental for weddings or private functions.<br><br>Hope you have fun during your visit.
6;Large collection of art;A beautiful art gallery, with a large variety of art to suit different tastes.  Would happily spend hours here!
6;New perspectives;I have been here several times. The curation of the exhibitions has wowed me every single time!!<br>One exhibition on the self - how we do dentify ourselves in so many different ways - by our jobs, where we live. Thought provoking at it’s best. <br>Another one on experiences of life in the 1800. <br><br>I love to be so provoked to see fresh!  <br><br>Visiting with our Group of Seven and their cronies never gets old either. <br>Thank you.
6;Best Art Gallery in Canada;Fabulous art gallery with several interesting exhibitions with paintings and objects. The Canadian Indigenous gallery was really well done. The Hispanic and European galleries were very nice. They also had a kids art appreciation event that day. The docent that led our tour was quite knowledgeable. Definitely worth a couple of hours visit.
6;Off to the AGO;This museum is on the small and therefore manageable size.  It has varied offerings from the Old Masters, to <br>very modern pieces.  Enjoyed the variety!
7;Great Hockey hall of Fame;Honestly it was a great experience. I'm not a die hard fan but I am a Rangers  because  of my husband. I have been a fan now since the playoffs in 2014. It was a great experience I like museums and if I wandered around then yea I was interested I left my husband to go explore. I left him upstairs with the Stanley cups all of them because I saw them while he slowly strolled around with his phone. I headed downstairs alone and looked at all the old players for all the teams and the jerseys and accessories they wore. They had a time Hortons theater with nothing on and the Canadian capitals locker room that no longer exists. the locker room has old jerseys from back in the day.
7;Definitely worth a visit;Great museum for hockey fans. Located in downtown. Lots of memorabilia. Great the way it showed hockey history. Movies of Russian Canada series were terrific. Fun interactive displays. Recommend it for hockey fans.
7;Hockey Lovers Heaven!;If you are a hockey fan, this museum is a must see when visiting Toronto. Loads of artifacts, such as pucks, jerseys and sticks.
7;Not a bad place for someone who doesn't know one end of a hockey stick from the other! :);I liked this place a lot.  I was with family who were keen hockey enthusiasts (I'm not) but I learnt lots and I really found it quite an enjoyable experience.  It's a shame that the interactive activities are generally dominated by kids as us grown ups would love a chance to have a go sometimes :)  Lots to see and some really interesting items exhibited.
7;Interactive and Informative;My husband and I are not huge hockey fans but couldn’t pass up the chance to check out the hockey hall. We were not disappointed. Along with an enormous collection of hockey memorabilia and great history, the hall offered great interactive experiences for young and old. The icing on the cake was the opportunity to snap a photo with the Stanley Cup. Worth the trip even if you don’t closely follow hockey.
7;Problem with scanning digital tickets;I bought tickets online and when I got to the HHOF the attendants were not able to read my digital ticket.  Then they did the number input by hand and still could not recognize the tickets.  We were allowed to enter but this caused a line-up.  I hope someone can explain why there was a problem.<br>We enjoyed the Hall of Fame and don't think this was their problem.
7;Hockey Heaven;As a hockey lover, this place was heaven. Just the right size for the 4 hours we spent there.<br>Staff were friendly and accomodating throughout - especially the interactive games guys!<br>I loved the shop, something for everyone! But a power cut prevented me for spending on the mountain of goods I wanted… the whole place had to close down, we waited an hour but no power - I suppose I should be thankful for saving almost $400 in the shop!
7;Great for hockey lovers!;Such a fun time! Learned lots, the quality of the museum itself is top notch! Such a beautiful place. Will definitely be back!
7;Amazing experience;As a fan of hockey most of my life, it was amazing to be taken back to remember so many great players and moments.
7;The Hockey Hall of Fame;This is a great museum. Lots of interesting facts about hockey and the players. We loved the 3D movie, it’s a must see. There are interacting displays, which are fun. I highly recommend this museum when in Toronto.
7;The hockey fan's dream day out;As a big ice hockey fan, this was and is for me a highlight of a trip. However it should be said that this is a very well set up museum to the game.  From explanations of how things are now to the greats of years gone by (the Gretzky/Howe exhibition was on when we went) there's a bit of something for someone with no idea about the sport to the hardened fan like myself.<br><br>The interactive games were fun (albeit taking a puck to the chest was a surprise, a save is a save I suppose) to the wall of goalie masks to the Grand Hall with all the NHL's trophies, I enjoyed myself thoroughly here. I can't pretend that I don't have a bias but my wife and son who aren't massive hockey fans enjoyed themselves too.<br><br>Recommendation: the entrance to the Hall of Fame is in the basement of the building, on the floor above by the shop is a Tim Hortons that does a Hall of Fame doughnut. Get that for a fun little treat.
7;Don't miss Lord Stanley's Vault;So the building that is pictured as the Hockey Hall of Fame is not where you enter.  You have to go through an entrance into a mall, walk through the mall to the escalators that take you to the food court and then you will find the entrance  to the Hockey Hall of Fame. <br><br>Best part was the Stanley Cup and Lord Stanley's Vault.  You can get your photo with the Stanley Cup for $10.  Which I thought was great.  You will get the photos when you go to the gift shop.  They have a kiosk that you get to pick from 2 photos as the "one" they will print.   Then they print you 3 large copies of it and give you a receipt that you can download the photo.  I really didn't need the actual photos.  I wish they would give you the option to not have them printed, since it was a waste of paper and ink. I just wanted the download.  <br><br>I was a little disappointed.  Not exactly sure what I expected, but I figured there would be displays of the winners of the Stanley Cup from the last 50 years or so.  The displays they had were nice, some really interesting pieces, it just left me wanting a little more.  <br><br>This is within walking distance to CN Tower and the Aquarium.<br><br>I am glad I came.   My husband and I loved the Esso Great Hall, The Mask and Lord Stanley's Vault.
7;Must See in Toronto;Very large collection of Hockey greatness!  Good video productions, excellent displays. The trophy room “cathedral “ is a must see. In the vault you find the history of the Stanley Cup.
7;Great Morning of interesting information;Lots to look at great history and nice interactive parts. We enjoyed the 30 minute 3D movie and showed some fantastic information of not just US and Candy but a global hockey background. Also,seeing the Stanley cup was awesome
8;<span>Learn more</span> about animal welfare in tourism;Best experience ever
8;We have been to Ripley’s many times. This time I wanted to do the stingray experience. It was one of the best things I have ever done. Well worth the money. The staff is amazing. They made us feel like we were royal. Gave us the best experience ever. I will definitely book this again 100%. I just want to thank the staff at ripleys for everything they did for us and the amazing family pictures.;Totally recommend
8;It was amazing! My 10 year old and I went two days in a row it was so awesome. Huge assortment of ocean life.;Way too crowded!
8;Ok, it was a holiday weekend….   And the exhibits were amazing, as always….  BUT, Ripley’s appears to have no limits on the number of people they allow in.  I felt like I was on the 401 at rush hour,  but without the protection of a vehicle.  People were losing their kids, bumping into one another constantly, blocking exhibits with non-stop selfies, etc.    Even the moving walkway felt crowded.  The sensory overload was just too much for this multi-generational family visit.  We may never return!;Pricey but nice
8;This is much too overpriced for what you get. Although if you have children under 6 there are more attractions. Beautiful exhibits.;Nice aquarium
8;Spectacular place to see. A little expensive but worth it. Some fish could use bigger tanks. My kids loved it.;Amazing aquarium but busy and pricey
8;<span>Learn more</span> about animal welfare in tourism;Mostly Worth It
8;It was a good place but a lot of money for 4 people. The gift shop was very expensive. But it was mostly worth the visit. Some of the species at the aquarium were cool, but some were average. But mostly worth it.;Okay…. But not worth the $$$
8;The aquarium was a good experience overall, however it was very expensive for a family of 3 (2 adults and 1 child). Some of the species have very small tanks and it’s sad to watch them just go round and round in circles. Food and drinks were very expensive so prepare to spend if you want to eat and drink there. Shops are nice but there again overpriced items.;First Aquarium visit
8;This was a great experience. We are both retired. We spent over 2 and a half hours looking at the displays. This is a great place for children and families. We will take our grand children the next time.. We saw the glass being cleaned inside and out, as well as a diver in the shark tank. The hands on area with the RAYS is a great finishing point.;A+ from a marine biologist
8;Very nice. I’m a shark researcher and I used to work at another aquarium. Ripley’s Aquarium of Canada is fabulous… well worth the visit, especially on a slow day (if that ever happens). Will return.;Extremely disappointed
8;Be aware,  given the chance, they will oversell tickets and it will be a very unpleasant experience. If you have small children, your entire time will be spent trying not to lose them in the crowds. The ventilation was obviously not keeping up with the number of people present making it hot and muggy. Lots of lineups. Would probably be best to go late at night to avoid the crowds.;Great for the whole family!
9;A good concept, bad management;The exhibits are good. My grandsons enjoyed the interactive activities. However, this is where the positive points end. It took more than 25 minutes to enter the parking lot. One may say that congestion can be expected in holiday weekends, but this applies to the center's management as well - they could have better organized the enterence, but they didn't care.<br>The transition from the entrance to the exhibit halls is done with shuttles ! more time in lines, both ways which is especially annoying on the way out when the kids are tired.
9;Lots of school kids today!;We went on a Friday, and I had a feeling it would be wild when I saw 60 (not kidding) school buses lined up outside the Centre. Kids everywhere! The cafeteria at lunchtime was loud and very few seats were available. After 2 PM it was families.<br>I recommend ordering tickets for the Omni-Max on line ahead of time because our choice was full. I DON’T recommend the Asteroid Hunter show at all as it presented a doomsday scenario. At this time, the ramp to the exhibits is closed and you can wait 5-10 minutes for a shuttle back and forth. The exhibits were great and I think everyone found a lot of interesting things.
9;Waste of time;Awful entry way.  Waited an hour in line, just to be shuffled to the next parking area.  Then arrive at the parking area and it was also closed.  1 1/2 hours of my day gone, a three hour drive from Kingston, and very sad and angry kids.  There is so much construction everywhere.  Very disappointed. I will not attempt to go again.
9;A great place for kids;This place would be amazing for kids. I don’t have any of those, so I only spent a couple hours. It was on the City Pass, otherwise I wouldn’t have gone. It seemed like the children were having a blast, so take your little ones.
9;OSC;To be honest, I expected more.  maybe it's meant for little kids, but adults can't get anything serious there.  Even the films shown cannot close the gaps.<br>Maximum 2 hours and you can finish your trip in OSC.
9;Good value for money and educational;My 12 year old son enjoyed the exhibits, his favourite being the science arcade. We attended Oct 2022 and there seemed to be renovations going on as the bridge was closed and we had to take a shuttle to the rear entrance (which was no issue). Many school groups in attendance so it was quite busy until about 3pm at which time is quieted down significantly.  Lockers were only $1 which I though was very reasonable. A bit disappointed the outdoor exhibits were closed as it was such a beautiful day.  A bit of a treck to get to from downtown, but def doable!
9;Ontario Science Centre is a must!;Unfortunately there were renovations going on at the Science Centre so had to take a shuttle around to the back entrance. With that we were unable to see anything on the first or second floor. <br>What we did get to see Floor 4-6 was really cool. We made it there to see the Van De Graaf demonstration!  There is plenty to see and do as it is interactive. Recommend to those 5 to 95! Plan to stay 3-4 hours minimum!
9;Lack of science education.;Since the science Center is supposed to be all about science and experimenting projects, it was lacking a lot of interesting science work. Because most visitors are youth groups, this place should have interesting, fun and learning projects for kids to see and learn about.
9;Must See;Awesome exhibits! You need a full day to see everything. Very entertaining for all ages! IMAX films were very entertaining too! Nice theatre! Clean! Very nice and friendly staff!
9;A decent experience, but pricey and not worth going twice;Thoroughly going through each exhibit was about a three hour experience. Sadly, I went when Levels 1, half of 2, and most of the outdoor areas were closed off, so I didn't get the full experience. I'm not sure why the OSC didn't give a discount to factor this in.<br><br>The exhibits were largely child-oriented, but there were also some that were strangely adult-oriented. Overall, there wasn't much beyond Level 5, but time flies by quickly as you pace yourself through all of the areas. A good experience, although the price of admission and parking was a bit stiff. Probably won't be going there again for quite some time.
9;Fun at Ontario Science Centre;It was a fun place to go with your family. Very informative and at the same time, kids will enjoy your stay for the whole day with lots of activities to do.
9;not to be missed!;what fun for the whole family. Many different activities on many subjects!!! <br>Lots of walking...and lots to do ! Hands on and experiential. <br>You need the day to really see it all. <br>have been several times and will go back! <br><br>Cafe has decent food and lots of variety, but it's pricey.
9;Plenty to see and do during March Break visit;We arrived early because we understood from reviews that you even have to line-up for parking. I wish we could pay for parking ahead of time, but we did move through quite quickly. It was raining, but many families (even with babies and little kids) lined up outside anyway. The Science Centre was kind enough to open doors early for that reason. The line moved quickly because they had staff to direct people with or without tickets, although we were still a little confused if we were in the right line. But once we were checked-in it was easy to go straight to the exhibits we were interested in with a little direction from the many staff available. We were surprised by how much we could do in two hours even with a March Break crowd probably because we arrived at opening. I saw a negative review about having to read too much stuff, but we found there was still plenty of interactive stations or videos to watch, and my kids (ages 10, 13 and even my husband) never seemed bored. We also ate at the cafeteria which was reasonably priced and seemed to have a good food selection and seating. The person who served us messed up the order, but otherwise no other complaints.
9;Do not like it;It does not have much fun interaction devices, which I believe should be the most important part of a science center. Too many words and explanations to be read. How does that suppose to work for kids? We only spent 2 hours go through everything and left. Definitely will not go there again.
10;Went for a visit with my mom (age 80) who was visiting from out of town. Buildings are closed, as was expected, but still a nice little stroll through the grounds. Fun to see the animals.<br><br>My disappointment comes from my interaction with the staff at the entrance. Before we entered, I asked the two women sitting there if there were benches along the path. I knew my mom would need to take a couple of breaks (knee issues). They didn't know! Seriously! They work there, but they don't know? Have they never walked through even once? One of them proceeded to tell me that *if* there were any benches, they would likely be taped off and we couldn't use them. They also informed us (in not too nice of a tone) that the path was one way only and that once we entered, the only way out was to complete the path.<br><br>Anyway, for the record, there are lots of benches (not taped off) -- and lots of low stone walls, also suitable for taking a quick break. As the exit is in a different place than the entrance, I didn't see them again -- otherwise I would have educated them about THEIR job.;Slice of Country in the Centre of the City
10;A total pleasure to wander here at Riverdale Farm, with it's fine gardens, array of farm animals, view over the Don Valley, and familiar farm smells . )<br>The kids will definitely love it, but grown-ups can also find some bliss here too...;Animals as seen by our Grandson
10;This February being a rather mild month we took our 2 year old boy (Grandson Clarkie) to the Riverdale Farm. The boy was thrilled and we spent two hours of smiles and giggles that went by all too fast.<br>Getting there was a snap by car and just as easy by public transportation I am given to understand. Parking is free and in abundance. Not too crowded in winter months and many of the livestock were still outdoors.ofcourse you can view lots of rabbits,turkeys,chickens goats and sheep indoors.<br>The horses ,cows ,pigs and lambs were all outside and equally big hits. Kids love animals and enjoy imitating the sounds they make. This place is fun free and educational! Take your child or grandchild  asap you won't be disappointed,;Little gem.
10;What a fabulous place to come unwind, and see some lovely animals! Super fun to stroll around, and then walk Parliament Street for lunch!;Lovely place in the city
10;Riverdale Farm has lots of trees and vegetation. The trails offer a nice opportunity to walk around the property and listen to the birds. There are cows, horses, sheep, goats, pigs and chickens. I think I'm missing other animals. I stayed for the animal presentation at 11:30 a.m., which was about the cows. The place is lovely. It's a good place for kids and adults alike. Easy to go there using public transportation. The admission is free, but you can donate what you want to support the farm. Recommended!;Could do with a cafe
10;<span>Learn more</span> about animal welfare in tourism;Surprising place in the heart of the city. Easy stroll with the little ones
10;Loved it. The kids had a blast. Easy to reach and easy to walk around. Amazingly close to downtown and accessible by public transit.;Going to the farm in the city!
10;When so many children only see eggs in the store, cows in pictures, goats and pigs in cartoons, a trip to the Riverdale Farm is a great experience. The setting is lovely, it is free, and area to run around. A jem in the city.;Great time
10;We loved the fact that this place is free of charge. It's more for walking rather than playing. If you have kids under 2, might be suitable for them. For older ones, I would suggest to take toys. If you love nature, it will be a good place! <br>;Quaint Farm in Cabbage Town
10;A lovely little destination for a sunny afternoon walk in Cabbage Town. The Farm is charming and rustic with horses, cows, chickens, turkeys, goats and sheep. Set beside a scenic pond, the farm offers an escape from the city for an hour or so.;Farm filled fun for young ones in the city
10;A gem in the city a must visit for all residents and for people visiting TO a relaxed retreat from the city.  Worth the walk thru! Kids LOVE coming here.  Enjoy;Very different for kids birthday!!

11;Go!;I love this museum.  It’s a large variety of artifacts, including mummy dating back to 715bc, and stone carvings from china and Rome..a must see.
11;Huge museum;I had heard good things about the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM), but my expectations of museums in Canada are pretty low.  But this visit proved me wrong.  This is a big museum.  It very much reminded me of the museums in Paris, or the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City... not nearly as big, but one can certainly spend an entire day there and not see everything.<br><br>We happened to be in Toronto on the Third Thursday of the month, so admission is free in the evening.  We got there right at 4:30pm, and the line up to get inside went down the entire block with probably hundreds of people waiting.  Thankfully, the museum is so big, that line up to get inside went really fast.<br><br>We took our time for the first 30-45 minutes, and was really impressed with the collections.  After visiting the T.Rex exhibit, we realized we were already there for over an hour and hadn't even finished the first floor.  Being mindful that we had teens with us, we started to go through bit faster to cover more ground.  By 2 hours, we barely finished the 2nd floor and got to the 3rd floor.  By that time, our kids had tapped out, so we decided to leave.  <br><br>Overall, a great museum with impressive collections.  If you love museums, you can easily spend a good portion of your day here.
11;Cool stuff;We went to this museum as part of the City Pass. There’s a lot to see, and I actually learned a good bit about evolution that I don’t remember for school. The current special exhibit by Kent Monkman is beautiful and emotional. Not sure how long it will be there, but try to see it. The dinosaurs were pretty awesome too. Lots of skeletons in this place, so kids probably love it.
11;Nice museum, great dino/fossil exibit;Really nice museum.<br>One of the better dinosaurs/fossil exibits ive seen so far.<br>Lots of learning/activities for kids.<br><br>I didnt care for the "furniture and pottery  exibits" so I walked trough them, but it still took me 3 hours to see the rest (included the reading of the info with the exibits).
11;Disappointjng;I found a 15%discount code online for admission, with that it still cost my family of 4 $93.00 to get in (part of this was an additional $8 per person for another exhibit) - I personally was very disappointed. Things are so unaffordable. If I’m paying $100 essentially for admission, I SHOULD NOT have to pay extra to see the “special” exhibits! My entry fee should entitle me to access to the ENTIRE MUSEUM. This is completely unreasonable to me, and I won’t be returning. We used to love coming here but now between cost of admission, seeing the “cool” exhibits, and travel back and forth and a meal it’s a $300 day for a small family, and not something fun and affordable we can do multiple times. The exhibit I did pay extra for was nice, but not worth an extra fee IMO. Everything is just a money grab now. Sad.
11;Terrible;The top two floors of the museum were closed without notice. I paid for the full ticket price and even made sure to navigate the website prior to going to make sure nothing was closed. We were unable to see so many regions we were excited to view. Terrible experience.
11;Good museum;We spent most of our time looking at the dinosaur exhibit which was very interesting. Lots of skeletons to see. These are what distinguishes it for me from other museums and were most interesting for the children.
11;A wonderful city resource and gem;Full disclosure, I have attended several FNLs, speaker events at the ROM before buying a membership this year but I love this place. I enjoy going after work to walk around to decompress for an hour after a stressful day. I enjoy the exhibitions the ROM brings in and feel I discover something each time at a venue easily accessed in the middle of the city. There were a ton of families there when i went on Sunday most recently and a soca/steel pan band.
11;Wonderful nature photography.;The annual nature photography exhibition is always a highlight, and it certainly was this time around. Don't miss it! I also enjoyed the Canadian Design exhibition on the same floor. A sour note: Hoping to get my afternoon coffee around 4 p.m., I learned that Druxy's stops serving at  4. As the museum is open until 5:30, that is simply ridiculous.
11;You're going to need a whole day to do justice to the ROM;Someone told me that you only need a couple of hours for the ROM. Boy were they underselling it. If you like to really take in the displays and read through the details, it'll be an entire day's activity. The section on China alone is a treasure-trove of historical information, covering the rise of Buddhism in China and details of Chinese burial ceremonies and architecture.
11;boring and static;Static displays in the "regions of the world" section. There was little background information for the displays. A comparison of how the exhibits of the regions changed over the milleniums would be great.<br>Elevators did not run between all floors - a problem as I am mobility challenged. <br>The "hot" food at Druxy's was cold.
11;I Love the ROM!;As a Member who had not been to the ROM for a long time, I've made 3 recent visits with different guests and have seen 4 of the current exhibitions.  The calibre and variety of the exhibits has been top-notch. <br><br>I loved the Wildlife Photography exhibition for its brilliant photos from such a talented field.  <br><br>The Canada Modern exhibition was fascinating, particularly the objects from the 70's when I arrived in Canada. I was thrilled to find some Rafael jewellery on display as I have some from that era.  <br><br>Yesterday, my daughter and I saw the stunning and powerful paintings by Kent Monkman.  Well worth seeing in person. Such drama and poignancy. The only criticism is that it's very hard to find within the Museum and the signage isn't good enough.  We had asked when scanning our tickets and the attendant couldn't even tell us what floor it was on.  Another visually impaired friend was at the ROM recently and just couldn't find it as there was nobody to ask on that floor.  However, I highly recommend seeing this incredible body of work.<br><br>I also checked out the Fantastic Beasts exhibit.  So creative and interesting, especially for Harry Potter and JK Rowling fans of the books and movies. The melding of the mythical beasts and the conservation efforts to save real creatures at risk of extinction was very effective. <br><br>My daughter lives in London and worked at the British Museum for 6 years and is now at the Royal Academy of Arts.  She was very impressed with the exhibits too but she did note that all customer facing staff in London museums are expected to know where current special exhibitions are located.  She also pointed out that the ugly blank sloped white wall in the main floor cafe was covered in dust.  She said you'd never see anything like that in the Great Court at the British Museum.  I did note an improvement in the cafe from my previous November visit in that there were staff cleaning tables regularly. <br><br>All in all, 3 very enjoyable visits with some worthwhile exhibits.  I will be renewing my membership.
12;<span>Learn more</span> about animal welfare in tourism;Zoo-minimal animals
12;Looking forward to a international zoo visit…if only there were animals to see.<br><br>The few that were there were either exhausted or hiding.<br><br>Thank goodness it was part of our City Pass purchase…eased the pain. <br><br>PS- don’t purchase the train ride, you would be offended at the lackluster experience. I strongly recommend the zoo’s foundation take a tour, and reconsider reinvesting into improvements.;Go when it’s warm
12;I’m sure the zoo is much better in the summer. We went in March because we had free admission on the city pass. They were very honest about exhibits being closed due to cold weather, so I’m not complaining. It’s just that there wasn’t much to see. The otters were very active, and we saw one polar bear. I’d never seen a soft shell turtle before, so that was cool too.;Memorable day for the hole family
12;Just Wow ! The BEST zoo! The whole family enjoyed it. It’s great that it’s open during winter. <br>Plus the Animals are very well treated. There’s so many animals to see! We Will def visit again during summer<br><br>VIP tour arranged us an outstanding memorable day even tho we were last minute. Very pleasant experience, highly knowledgeable, dedicated and helpful staff. Victoria our guide was simply amazing, she made sure our day was perfect and memorable. Thank you for everything, my son had a blast and still talks about how much he loved feeding the camels;Animal Encounter with Giraffes
12;We booked an animal encounter with giraffes. We had 3 young kids (3-5 years old). It was a special birthday present for my daughter who loves giraffes. I was a bit skeptical booking because I wasn’t sure that a mostly info based tour would be engaging enough for little people, especially given the cost. I have to say: Worth every penny. The kids were blown away (so were the adults). Even my 3 year old held on to every word about what the giraffes eat, how they play and sleep. Of course, meeting the giraffes was the biggest memory maker of their lives. They go so close and intimate. Our guide, Louisa, was literally the best. She was funny, animated, informative, patient with the kids and always thought about the safety of the kids. I would 1000% recommend the giraffe encounter for even little kids. With the purchase of the encounter, we also had access to the entire zoo which was a plus.;Well worth a visit
12;As far as zoos are concerned, this one is large and many of the animals have reasonably large enclosures and look well looked after.<br>Unfortunately the animals are caged and on display. The polar bear was rubbing his face back and forth on the glass window and looked quite distressed.<br>The paths diverge in so many places and you are backtracking a lot of times trying to find your way. Very few maps around and these were not really set up to show how to get from one attraction to another.<br>Still it was quite an enjoyable visit even in the winter. Having fewer crowds enhanced the visit.;Overall great place
12;<span>Learn more</span> about animal welfare in tourism;Amazing day for the family!
12;After seeing some of the poor reviews I was questioning taking the drive while visiting my mom. I am SO happy I decided to go with my instinct. The zoo is gorgeously laid out, animals have lots of room and lovely habitats. We were able to see all our ‘ must sees’ (although some were sleeping- obviously some animals are not going to be awake in the middle of the day when it is hot).  Our favs were the arctic wolves and polar bear. My only suggestion (and again we had a wonderful day despite this) would be to add some people working at the zoo to answer questions/add additional info for the animals in the viewing areas- ie the animals names, where they were brought to the zoo from etc. We were very interested and would have loved to see that the animals were rescued or at least have an idea of their origins. <br>Wonderful day spent- packed some food and lots of water. Water refill stations are well marked on the map :) I had 2 kids under 10 and my 72 yrs old mom and we had no issues. Well done Toronto Zoo!;Toronto Zoo - Wow, what can I say‽
12;This has got to be one of the most disappointing days out in Canada.  Such a poor layout of the zoo, no logical way to walk around and you find yourself backtracking over the same area over and over again.  <br><br>The Canadian domain is in accessible to some.  As the zoo mobile doesn’t go there and if you were unable to walk the steep hill you would be unable to visit though you wouldn’t miss much as all that was available there was the raccoons and the grizzly bear. As with much of the zoo half the areas both indoors and outside were closed off or animals not currently in view which should be mentioned before you buy your ticket to enter!<br><br>The whole place is over commercialised with every corner having a different food or drink stall or restaurant all of which we’re over priced.  Other than the toilets by the air ride the rest were all disgusting and stunk. <br><br>All in all would not bother visiting as it is a waste of money.  In the plus side the staff did all appear very friendly and enthusiastic especially the guides on the zoomobile.;Pandas were missing in the zoo
12;I didn't see any White Pandas in Toronto zoo. please update the photo on Toronto zoo profile. The profile picture is creating wrong assumptions;Embarrassing
12;It was embarrassing. Went this summer and saw NO animals, polar bears not our, wolves not our, foxes nor our, monkeys not out, tigers not out. Just a pathetic scam ripoff. Who the F has a zoo. With no animals to see and rid people off the way Toronto Zoo does. Embarrassing. Be smart people it’s a scam.;Very bad
12;Me and my family did not like this zoo at all there were barely any animals there were 5 house donkey things one giraffe only one!  And 2 goats and the rest of the animals like tiger and snake all looked dead!  But the mane point of this review was to help others and so I do not recommend going here it is a really big wast of money 😓😑🙄;Zoo (Ugh...)
13;Great thing to do on a rainy day;One of the best castles I have visited (including numerous castles in Europe). Minus one star for the parking charges (15CAD). There is no reason to leave the car here if you aren’t here to visit the castle - it seems excessive, given the admission itself is already 40CAD. Perhaps validate the ticket for 2 hrs and charge people that linger too long.<br><br>The castle itself was impressive. Most of the rooms were available with a nice audio guide. It is a self-guided tour with the last admission time at 4:30pm. It takes roughly 1.5 hrs to go through it, so please plan accordingly.<br><br>The garden and the towers were closed during our visit. But we still got to see and learn a lot. Don’t miss out on the tunnel and the celebrity walk.
13;Poor communication. Sections closed during Easter weekend;Easter meant that sections of the castle were closed to the public for the gala brunch. <br><br>This was indicated by a photocopied A4 sheet without any details indicating which sections were closed. The ticket office didn't indicate this either.<br><br>When we tried to get into the library (probably the most interesting part) the staff were rude and unhelpful when we tried to raise the issue of no one communicating this at the ticket purchase.<br><br>The only highlight of the otherwise boring and militaristic tour was seeing Camilla Parker Bowles' portrait hanging amid portly old duffers in uniform. <br><br>At least Diana got a theater named after her.<br><br>Avoid at all costs. Watch X-Men instead.
13;Amazing Experience!;Amazing experience! We've been to A LOT of castles...this is awesome! Seeing a "modern" castle and how technology has been integrated is super interesting. Throw in the military history and there's something for most everyone! Can't imagine this place during high season, but this seems the perfect time to visit!
13;glad we went;some interesting history, nice rooms to see. Kids would enjoy tunnel.  Can listen to history and room descriptions on your cell phone, which was nice.  Probably 1-2 hours there, depending on how much you want to learn/listen/see.
13;Casa Loma Dragon event 2023;We love Casa Loma, and try to visit the castle as often as we could. We visited Casa Loma 16th of March, 2023. The main idea was to see the "Dragons event" with kids. It was the only one main dragon, and a few were standing in the garage area. The lighting was pure to take photos or make a video. Some areas were closed. The strong spicy  very specific smell from the cafeteria was following us even after we left the Casa Loma. We feel that the price is too expensive for this visit.
13;Super Cool HIstorical Castle;We spent a couple of hours touring this incredible castle in Toronto. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We only had a few hours, so they told us which highlights to hit. Per their tips, we skipped the audio guide and this allowed us to see everything on our own. The history of the castle is neat, and a lot of the furnishings are original. Loved the secret tunnels!
13;What they took...;Had a coupon on my phone that they wouldn't accept, needed to be printed to be "authentic" so much for keeping the carbon foot print low but is very fitting for this place. Staff was friendly aside from the woman selling the tickets at the entrance. This experience is sooooo incredibly over priced, a gauge, but I mean when you take the entire story in of this poor man's wealth, empire, worth, legacy and the thievery involved in his downfall... you really understand how "the powers" literally stole one man's built empire and turned it into a turn style exhibition for tourists to marvel at and not really understand.
13;Skip the daytime tour and go for dinner if appreciate a foodie experience and don't mind paying the price.;The price is not appropriate for the experience. The facility did not limit occupancy or traffic flow within the exhibit. It was more of a museum/gimmick experience than an actual "castle of old" display.<br>I did go again after hours for a dinner at the restaurant and the experience was completely different without the excessive crowds. Felt much more grand, and I appreciated the ambiance so much more.
13;Worse experience ever!;Staff at this place have no knowledge about their service! I called them and asked if the city pass works for their Christmas festival of light . They said yes. I got 8 tickets for my family and we when there, paid for the parking and at the entrance they told us: the city passs is not valid for visiting festival of light!<br>I said but when I called your staff and asked specifically, they said it is valid! They said oh our staff didn’t know!!!<br>Do I have to pay for their misguidance!<br>We waisted hours of our time to travel and over $900 for their miss information!
13;Christmas at The Castle - Not Worth It;We live nearby and always say we will go to see the lights. We finally made it happen this year and it was spectacularly underwhelming. We paid the additional $50 for the VIP pass in order to bypass the line - of which there was none, and get two tickets for a "drink and food". We were offered hot chocolate or coffee and 4 donut holes (maybe a $20 value for both of us). The lights were beautiful and there were a couple of fun displays, like the singing reindeer and penguins. They could have had a fire to stand by, some seating with blankets, and more food and drink options - definitely not worth the $100 for two people plus the $50 VIP.
13;If in doubt, GO! Its spectacular;Juat look at the pictures. It’s amazing. The virew from the tower was panoramic spectacular. They also serve good food. This is a dont miss in Toronto 🤩
13;Just fabulous;Absolutely worth a visit, beautiful place full of history, good coffee shops, and great gift shop! Stunning all round views. We will be back!

14;It was a very fun experience overall.;Really enjoyed the ride i got on since it was not too fast for me. I checked the weather and was glad to go on the best weather day. Did get there early and was able to enjoy the experience before the crowds got larger and was glad that i did. Did notice that the cost of even roasted corn was a bit much but did love the mini donuts and pub type foods and drinks, sorry I missed the dog show but hope to catch it next year.
14;Retro video game area brings back memories;Not gone to a cne in a 5 years<br>Lot of the buidling as close or sold tor other events like the old automoblie building<br>Got to see the retro video event area and just love the old games I use to play while<br>growing up and my friends with me also had fun.  Wish they had more of it and other<br>events that get people remember their young days.<br>All in all this cne was ok,  and if they have the retro video area again I will be back with my friends
14;Lots of fun for the whole family;First time going to the Exhibition in 3 years since the pandemic. Parking was $40 and adult admission was $25 adults and $20 for seniors. They have lots of rides, carnival games for prizes. There’s a casino and casino patio. Also the traditional air show. We did the Superdogs Pawvengers show. There are so many shows and events going on everyday. Lots of outdoor food trucks and a food building with lots of choices. There is so much to do here that you can spend the whole day. This is an event that becomes a family tradition every year and the CNE is a Canadian tradition in Toronto and it’s been around 137 years.
14;The CNE is seriously overcrowded, especially on the weekend,  and the prices are totally outrageous!!;Don’t go, especially on a weekend like we did last weekend, because the crowding is totally crazy and the price of everything is totally outrageous!! You’ll line up for at least an hour for the same food you could have bought at home for much cheaper. Be prepared for $4 water and $8 for a cob of corn, and that’s the cheap stuff. The Food building is totally overcrowded with long line ups. Forget about finding a place to sit. anywhere. We went specifically to see Jersey Nights which was on at the midway stage but we didn’t even get to see the whole show because they told us to leave because we weren’t buying their overpriced drinks. This isn’t mentioned on the CNE list of events online. My husband has a serious spinal cord injury and can’t stand long. From what we could see you won’t even get near the rides. I’d advise that you save  your money and go elsewhere. We wish we had.
14;Pure Money Grab…;Expensive money grab. <br><br>While I understand we’re dealing with inflation, I just get a sickening feeling when paying for everything.<br><br>Might as well take the kids to Canada’s Wonderland as the prices seem in alignment.
14;Wow what a huge event;First time here and we were impressed. Way too much to cover in one day, but we tried our best. The farm area was fantastic for little ones. Our little one had such a good time in that building. The kids area was also a hit with her. The midway, both kids and adult was huge. The food options were also huge...so hard to choose what to eat. The super dogs show was a great hit also. Definitely something we hope to do again.
14;Prices high and dope smokers;Parking $40. Unlimited rides $55. or 22 tickets for $22. Large Corn dog $12. Mini donuts $7.50 doz. Coke machine $5.  Lots of dopers smoking up out in public with zero enforcement.  Not impressed with taking my grandchildren. Things need to be cleaned up before I go back.  I bought 6 tickets and 5 ride passes and meals and drinks.  Approx $400 day.
14;Money grabbing food/drink vendors!! As well as insane midway game prices! Just Disgusting;WoW CNE 2022 let me tell you this, you better have deep pockets!!!!!! The price gouging is unreal not as bad as Woodstock 99 on the third day but  wow!! The original price of  ride all day pass at almost 70$ is ridiculous of and don't forget if spend even more money you can skip the line and have priority and make every other shmuck wait even longer!!!! Oh did you wanna throw some darts at balloons well get ready to spend 10 dollars to throw 3 darts. I understand inflation but what increased the balloon prices by 1000% or the air inside the balloons!!! Just absolutely crazy prices.
14;Return of the CNE;On Sunday, September 1, 2019, I went to the Canadian National Exhibition.  I bought my lunch at the Food Building - a sub sandwich from the Steak and Cheese Factory, some fries from the same vendor, and a coffee from Hula Girl - and ate them outside.  It was the weekend of the Canadian International  Air Show, so I watched the planes fly overhead while eating lunch.<br><br>After I finished my lunch, headed down to the "bleachers" / Bandshell Park to watch the remainder of the airshow, which ended with the Snowbirds.  <br><br>After the airshow was over, I walked through the midway past the rides and games, to Oktoberfest, a Bavarian-themed food truck and craft beer festival on Princes' Boulevard.  I'd buy myself a 'glass' of Wasaga Beach beer, and spin the wheel to win a prize at one of the games  and would win a Wasaga Beach tote bag.  I stuck around and took in the Bavarian-themed music and entertainment on stage sung in German as well as English.
14;The (Air) Show Must Go On!;Although the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE) was cancelled again due to the ongoing pandemic - going ahead with the fair would have likely  created a potential super-spreader event considering the sheer numbers who attend it - the Canadian International Air Show returned for the Labour Day weekend.  It was safe enough to proceed with the air show. people attending it in person could stand two feet apart. the cancellation of the CNE freed up space.   The (air) show must go on!<br><br>The air show drew modest sized crowds of aviation aficionados to the Toronto waterfront, to both the Exhibition grounds and Ontario Place.  The weather was ideal, a mixture of sun and cloud, and not too hot and humid.  There were a couple of festivals at Ontario Place, one of them actually provided commentary of the aircraft flying overhead.  At the south end of Ontario Place, the Vista Eatery had an air-show themed menu.  Attendees at the Toronto Undergraduate Jazz Fest listened to the music on stage and watched the air show at about the same time.<br><br>The air show featured various aircraft - F35, the CF18, the Gryphon helicopter and a few other acts, and ended with the Showbirds.
15;if less people, shorter waiting time will be better;we buy a family pass which is for 4 people, so we can ride on all the rides, but actually we don't have enough time to play all of them, as some of them required a long waiting time, e.g. the roller coaster need to wait for an hour, it's too much time, and the swing also need to wait for half to one hour, so we can't play this one and the bumper car as we don't have enough time, we already spend 5 hours there, but still not enough time to play all rides. But we do tried a number of rides, e.g. the lift chair, the boat, ferris wheel, and some younger rides for my kids. We do have a happy day except we can't ride all we want due to super long waiting time for some of the rides.
15;Childhood memories and the tradition continues!;Childhood memories and the tradition continues. We took our 2 granddaughters to Centre Island on a Thursday mid day end of August. Prior to our visit it rained but rest of the day was nice and sunny! We got there by Tiki Taxi private water taxi that leaves the docks at the foot of Spadina and very glad we weren’t packed into the larger ferry.  We purchased wrist bands for the whole family and enjoyed the freedom to go on all the rides. There were no line ups at all except for maybe one or two children and we managed to get to all rides we wanted to try during our visit. It was a nostalgic visit as some rides looked the same as when I was a young child. Each ride was well maintained. There was no wait to buy pizza, subs or ice cream and the we found a quiet spot under the trees in the outdoor eating area. Other than a few wasps our outdoor eating experience was perfect. We found the ride staff to be quite helpful and pleasant. We finished the day with a cool off in the splash pad and found the Muskoka chairs in the shade a nice spot to relax while the girls played in the water. Note - the water refill station faces the splash pad if you need your water bottle filled and washrooms are located back there too. <br>I went to this park as a child over 50 years ago and I brought my own children over 25 years ago and now we have let our grandchildren experience the same fun and continue the tradition. Don’t miss this beautiful place for young children and lovely mature parks for a day trip to an island minutes from downtown Toronto. <br>Thanks to all the staff at Centre Island for a wonderful day!
15;Pack your patience (and food);- ferry to/from the island was JAMMED. Waited 30 mins for the ferry to the island and watched passengers and crew yelling at each other. Massive line to go back so we bit the bullet and paid for the water taxi back. WELL worth the $12pp- would do that both ways next time. A much calmer experience.<br><br>- tried 3x (2 separate cards) to purchase passes online. Ended up having to pay more at the park. We all got all day passes. Could have saved a few dollars if we had just gotten passes for the kids and tickets for adults. There was only a few rides for us “big kids” <br><br>-lunch at cider bar was TERRIBLE. Shortest line so we picked there, still waited 40 mins for cold food. They were out of half of their items. Cashier was fine but the back end staff was rude. Actually rolled her eyes and walked away from a customer asking something simple <br><br>Ride line up weren’t that bad. The little rides usually didn’t even have a line. Longest wait was maybe 30 mins.<br><br>Overall, the kids had a great time but it was very expensive and a lot of stress for us adults. We went on a Saturday so that also contributed to the crowds. I think Santa’s village or storybook gardens is an easier adventure.
15;Fun day;We had a fun day out. We bought ride wrist bands instead of ride tickets so we could ride whatever we wanted all day. Our older kids 9 and 8 had a blast and went on many rides. The late afternoon got a lot more crowded but the morning and early afternoon was pleasant. <br>Our main complaint was that on a very hot day in the afternoon it was very difficult to find a place to buy a cold drink. Went to 3 places and waited in line to be told they were out. Finally went to the beaver tails place for frozen strawberry lemonade which was the only drink they had there but it was good. <br>The ferry both ways was extremely crowded and the cost was $25 for our family. <br>Food at the park was expensive and not very good. We ended up with Pizza Pizza. Next time we will bring food and more drinks! <br>Overall it was worth checking out. We enjoyed the log flume ride and the kids absolutely loved the scrambler ride!
15;Extremely overcrowded and overpriced;Visited on a weekday to avoid extra busy times ie. weekends/holidays.  Waited 20-30 minutes in line for a 45 second  log ride that I paid $8 per person for.  Decided to leave after this one and only ride...and after waiting in line 15 minutes for food as well.  My kids were fed up of and bored.  <br><br>Way to crowded  and besides that, overpriced.  Not enjoyable at all.
15;First aid caution and experience with Toddlers at the park;Date: Sunday in August <br>Time spent: 1030am -2pm<br>Cost: $80/day<br>Who went: 2 adult, 1 toddler (2 year)<br>Cost breakdown: <br>parking $25/ferry ride $20/ tickets for 2 rides $20/ pizza at park and snack $10/ Starbucks coffee back on mainland $15<br><br>*toddlers dont really need rides,we did it for an experience and we packed our lunches to save on costs.<br><br>Pros: ferry ride enjoyable, lots of space on the island to walk around and enjoy the water. Farm small but free and cute animals. Toddlers like to watch the planes and watch others on rides (makes for a cheap but enjoyable outing). Staff friendly. Water splash pad good. <br><br>Cons: food and tickets expensive. A lot of the rides are for kids over 4 feet tall. Many things closed up such as games, mini putt, and some rides. Looked a little run down in areas. <br><br>MAJOR CON: "first aid"<br>The first aid station, does not really have anything except for Band-Aids and gauze. Keep this in mind that this is not a true first aid station. For context, my daughter was stung by a wasp and I am allergic myself. I had my EpiPen but I was not sure if my daughter carried the same allergy. I forgot Benadryl at home. I searched for someone who sold Benadryl just in case she had a reaction and it would buy me some time to get her to the mainland. They were not helpful and did not offer any solution. Luckily she was ok.<br><br>I feel that at a park with children, especially since you are on an island and away from the hospital, there should be a legit first aid station in case of an emergency or at least to prevent one. Over the counter items such as Benadryl should be sold so that parents can choose whether or not to administer the drug to their child. What worries me is that if my child had a reaction, she would have not had the help needed to delay and give her time to get help.
15;Great Family spot;Been a couple times with my wife and now 5 year old daughter and it doesn’t disappoint! From the boat ride over to the great kids rides at Centerville! See u next year!
15;Enjoyable Afternoon;Among other things, we spent an hour at the amusement park eating ice cream and watching the kids play in the water park. Everyone was having a great time. Lineups for the ferry can seem daunting, but they handle more people than on might think. All in all, spending an afternoon on the Toronto Islands is very pleasurable. Buying ferry tickets online expedites things.
15;So expensive, but child's smile is (probably) worth it;Bought an adult (more than 4 feet) and child (4 feet or less) daypass--offensively expensive--but it ended up working out nicely. The same rides were enjoyed multiple times. thank goodness we didn't have to count tickets. The log ride was probably the most fun, and we even saw a non-walking toddler brought onto the ride! Overall, we got to spend a solid 4 or 5 hours there, and once I got over the price shock, the rest of it was above expectations.
15;Kids Enjoy this the most on Toronto Island;Lots of kids friendly rides make interesting place for kids on this mighty Toronto Island Park. Ferry to Island was great and the beach was not open due to some unsafe conditions. Overall you can spend the whole day on these islands.
16;Must Do Activity in Toronto;This is a fun place to visit while you are in Toronto.  Although the price of admission is a little steep, the 360 view of the city is well worth it.  I also purchased a ticket for the Skypod for an extra $10 which was fun as well, and is noticeably higher up!  However, there is much less space in the skypod to walk around and you'll probably get out relatively quickly.  There is a great gift shop with a ton of stuff for anybody, as well as a cafe at the bottom of the tower.  I thought these had pretty decent prices given that this is a huge tourist attraction.
16;WARNING : Do Not pre purchase your tix: NO REFUNDS FOR CRAPPY WEATHER AND NO VISIBILITY.;WARNING: WARNING: Do NOT buy tickets ahead of time at this attraction!! Despite being a tourist attraction and tourists having to leave Toronto on a schedule, they will NOT GIVE A REFUND for CRAPPY WEATHER!!  So much for kind Canadians. Zero visibility at 10am on April 22, 2023, they said come back anytime this pM, still zero vis in PM and they said oh no, we don’t give refunds but “Book it for Next time you come back.” Thanks for taking our 172 bucks, we will not be returning.
16;Good experience;Very good experience, delicious food and good service with beautiful view. But the restaurant don’t have a table with window because they only have table for 2 persons and we are 3 persons. That’s why I give 4 stars .
16;Loved it;Great experience. I cannot lie, the elevator freaked me out going up. My daughter and I have done similar experiences in other places so we knew what to expect. The views were spectacular. However there were too many people in when we went. It was super crowded. So we didnt spend much time up
16;Beautiful views;We went to visit the tower very early, as soon as it got open in the morning and it was a good idea. We were almost alone for some time and managed to enjoy the view and take nice pictures. We also went to the higher deck, it was nice but personally for me not much difference from the normal deck. I also liked short and concise facts about the tower at the beginning of the experience, available both in English and French. The gift shop was great, we bought all the souvenirs for friends and family there.
16;CN Tower around dusk along with a meal.;Enjoyed a lovely meal around dusk, circulating gently as the sun slowly dipped below the horizon with a beautiful orange glow.   Meal was lovely, with attentive staff, running at our pace.  Views were stunning.
16;Pleasantly Surprised;Wasn’t sure if we were going to enjoy this but we sure did. It’s not just another tower, it’s history.  Price was alittle high, get it, but get there early. It can become tight and I’m sure very warm up there.
16;a great dining experience;It has been MANY years since I visited this tourist attraction but remember it well, due to  the high cost of the tour and the restaurant.  With some new family visiting it was time to return.  We had 4:30 Good Friday reservations and all went on schedule, if they allow 20 minutes for check in and the ride up.<br>We were greeted nicely and taken to our window seating.  Wait-service was helpful and attentive throughout the meal, returning even to identify some of what we were seeing in the city.  <br>Three of us went for the 3-course meal and ordered the seafood chowder, salmon, and chocolate dessert.   The soup was very tasty but more, or bigger, pieces of seafood would be recommended to justify the price.   I was pleasently surprized at the nice portion of Salmon and the dessert.  Beautifully done and served.<br>Overall, a big smile goes to this experience.<br><br>Expect to pay approx. $100 per person for this or don't go.
16;Love it;Nice experience even at night. Beautiful pictures. Great location. We we able to get special discount on the website. Recommend pay parking across the street.
16;Tallest structure I've been on;Beautiful view of the entire Toronto skyline. Go on a clear day so you can see more. The glass floor is very cool.
16;Pleasant but costly visit, on a sunny March Break day!;It was fun to take our grandchildren up the tower to enjoy the view and a meal there together! The meal price came a quite a shock since we hadn’t been there for years and it was a birthday treat provided by our daughter! But to open the menu and see a minimum $75 charge per person was a shock! The meal was tasty, but certainly not what I normally expect for a $75 charge! We lucked out with lovely sunny weather that day in what had been a snowy rainy cold week! Glad we had this opportunity, but those visiting should be well prepared for the cost of elevating being part of the meal charges. Good but pricey visit. Perhaps try to include the other spots to visit in Toronto in the 5 option packet to keep costs down!
16;Marvelous;A marvelous tour. An empirical view. A powerful and historical experience. I dreamed of staying on it for ever.

17;Food Truck’n Weekends;In the Liberty Grand dome front steps area are multiple food trucks parked every weekend (12-8 Sat-Sun). Choose from Liberty Grill, Gogi meat, Jerk Bro, The Arepa Republic Venezuelan, Buster’s Sea Cove, Beavertail sweets, and Naansense Fusion, plus more. I recommend Alijandro’s Fawaffle Avo Chicken or vegan original cones ($12, 10). Masks can be purchased ($2) and sanitizer is available for eating on the greens, facing the breakwaters on the other side of Lakeshore. Limited outdoor seating means you should arrive 1:00-1:30 to grab a table. Washrooms are available and entrance is free (payments contactless). Vendors do not sell drinks. Beer is available on site separately for sale. Families should bring tetra drinks, and maybe sunscreen. Entrance off Lakeshore is just West of Ontario Place.
17;Royal Agriculture Winter Fair;What an experience! Our trip included the RCMP Musical Ride which was excellent. Beautiful well trained horses moving in unison and other intricate manoeuvres. It was of course very busy at the fair and there is just so much to see. Well groomed animals of all kinds. We couldn’t take it all in. Next year we will plan to spend a bit more time. Taking the GO to Exhibition place made the trip quite easy. Looking forward to next year!
17;Royal Agricultural Winter Fair;Friday November 1st 2019. My children and I went to the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair for a second year in a row. We love animals so we enjoy seeing all the different farm animals and that you can get up close and touch most of them. I like the educational aspect and being able to read about the different types/breeds of animals. We watched the Super Dogs Show which we loved and found it very entertaining, we also watched the sheep herding demonstration which was a little slow at times and a bit repetitive, but was great to see once. <br>We also paid extra for the evening horse show which was also opening night. It was very entertaining and great to watch. We absolutely loved the RCMP Musical Ride! It was amazing and I would definitely watch again! <br>We ate lunch, which was mediocre and very pricey, especially after paying the entry fee plus the horse show tickets it ends up being a very expensive day out, but not quite worth the money. <br>We also visited the Pizza Pizza Petting Zoo which my kids really love, but after this visit I will not be returning. I got a very sour taste in my mouth after the owner(I believe) of the petting zoo yelled at my daughter for feeding a few strands of hay to one of the goats. He told her not to do it, which my daughter of course felt terrible and came running back to me feeling awful. But then he proceeds to follow her and then continue his tantrum of why she shouldn’t feed them the hay (which he admits that it is his hay to feed them at night) because we have to pay for the food that they supply. I just spent almost $25 on those cups of food because my kids love the petting zoo so much, to have the owner speak to my daughter as if she is a criminal, telling her if he catches her again he will have her thrown out of the area! Let me be clear she only fed one goat, a few strands of hay. She was not going around feeding multiple animals!!!! And my daughter is 11 years old! She was in tears! An 11 year old girl who adores animals and would never do anything to harm them! This man was more concerned about his wallet being affected than anything else! VERY poor taste, and shame on him! So his need to cause a big scene and feel all mighty and powerful over a child has left us with a poor experience and will not be returning! You spend that kind of money there to be left with that kind of experience, not worth it!
17;Went to the CNE just this past weekend;My family and I have been going to the CNE every summer for as long as I can remember. I haven't been to the CNE in the past few years, so I wasn't really sure what to expect from the CNE 2019. This year, there was no more ice skating events to watch, and there were, in a way, less events/programs happening. We only went to the CNE for their shows this time around. The ILL-Abilities Dance Crew was pretty good. The Food Truck Frenzy was okay. Near the Food Truck Frenzy were a few trucks giving away free samples. The Under $6 in the 6 food trucks were disappointing. Thought there would be at least 12 food trucks in the area. The Godzilla, or the activity known as Chill with Zill was disappointing. We thought that there was an actual recreation of Godzilla somewhere near or on the CNE grounds. It was just an inflatable balloon version of Godzilla. Rather it looked like a flimsy dinosaur for children. The Food Building had some coupons to use... though most of the food has become increasingly pricier as time goes on. The Farm was good. Saw baby versions of pigs and turkeys. Saw more variety in the animals. Some of the activities in the booklet seem that there was more to it. In reality, there was barely a section for the activity.<br><br>The CNE has gotten worse over the years. I don't know if the CNE had the ice skating show last year. Or if they had their sand sculpting activity. I don't think I'll be going next year. The CNE is lacking a lot of attraction.
17;good;Went today.  <br><br>PROS:<br>- The rides are pretty straightforward, if you like them usually, you'll like them here.<br><br>- The Farm was cool.<br><br>- There's a nice little garden area near the farm building that's really nice and a good getaway if you're overwhelmed.<br><br>- Lots of variety in food, plenty of food locations everywhere.<br><br>- The shop places were interesting.<br><br>- Cat show!  Woo!<br><br>CONS:<br>- Very crowded depending on the time of day.  By extension, lines can get painful.<br><br>- A guy threw up near me and it was gross<br><br>- The Food Building is kinda hard to navigate<br><br>- Very expensive to get ride tickets,  actually in general its pretty expensive.<br><br>So all in all, its gotta be a thing you're ready for.  If you still wanna go after reading this then you'll enjoy this.
17;Not much bang for your buck;This year's CNE is a letdown compared to previous years, went on Sat August 24, it's still the same old VENDORS not much better,  same games , rides and less entertaintment,  more expensive food in a old building that needs to be demolished just like the former Stadium.  No desinated smoking areas , the smell of pot in bandshell park and limited food VENDORS.  The only highlight was Jan Arden. CNE in dire need a of complete overhaul , can they build a permanent skywheel and how about new food building and a Alpineway 2, less flea market and more tons of fun . Instead of winning stuffed animals how about winning gift cards or food discounts or ride coupons.  Skipping next year's visit as it will the same old,  not worth another bad review
17;CNE - A Family Tradition;My family goes to the CNE almost every summer. The school board usually has free tickets for kids and I would enjoy the early bird tickets or any special deal to go as a family - makes it a very affordable day trip for us. There are always many free shows with the exceptional quality of performance as well as hundreds of booths/shops for shoppers. As a day trip, just the shows, food and shops will easily use up our 10 hrs there, so we haven't been doing many rides over the years. I think the parking fee is very expensive (I know it's downtown). Personally, if we dine there for lunch, snack and dinner (since we spend 10 hrs there), plus $35 parking it will not be so affordable. Thankfully we can always bring our own food so we can spare the money for shopping for some unique or little things there. I believe if the parking fee can be lower it'll more accessible for many more families.
17;Big Disappointment;Nov 11th, the last day of the fair, we took my father, who is in a wheelchair to the fair. He recalled what a good time we had in the past bringing me as a young child and asked if my husband and I could take him there <br><br>After spending $75.00 for entrance fee, we learned you needed to purchase another ticket if you wanted to see the horse show. First disappointment. <br><br>We entered the area where the horse stalls were  only to find empty stalls. Everyone had taken their horses back home I guess except for ones in the show. Second disappointment. <br><br>We went to the small animal area which was not easily accessible for someone in a wheelchair. The gated area where the animals were did not have a ramp at the entrance and in-the area the Flores’s covered in shavings making it extremely difficult to move the wheelchair.   Third disappointment <br><br>Don’t charge a fee to see the animals and then find out they are no longer there because it’s the last day. Don’t charge me twice, once to enter and then again if I want to see a show. its misleading. And accessibility is expected to ensure inclusion. <br><br>Would I return... no chance. It was a big disappointment with a big price tag. <br><br>
17;and ROYAL AGRICULTURAL WINTER FAIR is AMAZING!!;Monday, November 5, 2018, we accompanied our daughter and grandchildren (aged 10 and 9) to the Winter Fair.  I can't say enough about how wonderful the experience was and how well organized the event was.<br><br>Our grandchildren LOVED seeing a sheep shearing exhibition, cow milking, learning about chickens and egg laying data, bees and honey varieties.  They watched 3 different horse shows and were amazed by the diversity of horsemanship from the "simple" just riding to the jumping.They even got to ride the "fake" horses for a real treat.  Feeding the llamas was a highlight for our granddaughter and our grandson was WOWED learning about all the sugar and salt "hidden" in foods that aren't good for you.  There were SO many displays and we would have loved to have had more time to see it all.  KUDOS to the organizers!<br><br>They were wowed by the GIANT PUMPKINS  and all of us found something special to eat and enjoy at the food court...even though we could have done without the "beaver tails". <br><br>This is a MUST GO place for people of all ages and is a bargain in our opinion.
17;Royal Agricultural Winter Fair;Always an amazing time and for a number of years I have made it a point to go yearly to this show of agriculture. I went regularly as a child in the 1980s/1990s and have so many happy memories of the horses (I was always amazed at the sight of the draft horses), the petting zoo, and what was always a favorite of mine, the Superdogs show. <br><br>There have been a number of changes since my childhood visits. The petting zoo was once able to be walked through. while they still have a popular petting zoo you can no longer mingle with the animals in the corral, I can imagine they no longer due this due to liability issues but you can still pet/feed the animals through the fences.  There was once a popular Celebration of Dogs which featured a number of breeds and you were able. this is no longer. There are more vendors, selling various gifts, farm equipment and food to a larger degree than I remember, so to me it seems like it has become more commercial? <br><br>Still, regardless of the changes, a yearly must for me and an experience I recommend for all, regardless of your ages. there is a lot to take in, learn and enjoy at the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair!
17;Toronto=Exhibition Place;There are many attractions to see at exhibition place. You have the the Coca-Cola stadium and the BMO field to watch sporting events and concerts. You also have the rides and concession stands every year around September. Come visit and be amazed.
17;Always awesome;How anyone can complain about this place is beyond me. Hundreds of vendors...from high end electronics to sheer crap, something for everyone. <br><br>Tons of food options, both traditional and crazy weird!!! Lots of amazing rides and games, and free shows. <br><br>Yes it can get busy, and depending when you go, parking may take more effort than normal, but this place is amazing for all ages. We go with pepper ranging from 5 to 92!<br><br>Don’t think. GO!
18;Best to Avoid;This park is just a boardwalk along the Lake, at the mouth of the Humber River.   It just too many people and too crowd.  Best to avoid if you want a quiet walk.
18;Close to the city and nice beach. Coffee? Yes. But not so good;The smalll beach and park are a great spot to hang out with young kids. They can bike and there is a park nearby<br>When it comes to eat the Cafe there has a great voew and location however the food isn’t that great. Coffee was mediocre
18;Beautiful place;One of the best places to have a lovely calm time.Cycling tracks and walkways as well. places to have family picnics.
18;my favourite place in Toronto;beautiful and peaceful place just downtown Toronto, at the same time beach and park with benches and tables for picnics and such a good restaurant the pavillon<br><br>great place!
18;Quiet Sunday on the beach: too cold!;Yet, as others have said, the views are super. Lots of seabirds and some swans all over. I can just imagine lying in the sand or having a picnic.  Nice huge building by the beach with lots of potential. I guess all they need is money to redo it. Huge, and I say huge, swimming pool -- closed for the season. Maybe next year.
18;Loved every second!;How fortunate we were to find this wonderful park/beach on the edge of Lake Ontario during our visit to Toronto. <br>The beach is beautiful, very clean, and swimming is permitted in the lake. Several trees on the beach provide some shelter from the heat of the July sun, and there are also some logs on the beach to sit on to avoid the heat of the sand. <br>Surprisingly the beach was almost deserted until early afternoon when more people arrived, but the atmosphere was still very tranquil. <br>Wonderful. Please visit for yourself because it's well worth it. <br>I hope this was helpful.
18;Beautiful escape from the city;Amazing place to walk and take in the view during the summer.  The west side is quieter and more suited to families. Easily hit you 10k steps for you day and not even feel it.
18;West end alternative to the Beaches;Park located on a strip between Lake Shore Boulevard and Lake Ontario. Martin Goodman Trail passes through the park. Lifeguards are on duty in the beach during summer. The boardwalk is nice along shoreline. There are some fast food vendors in busy days. Parking is nightmare during weekends.
18;Great Views;Went there with my friends. Its a nice place for families and youngsters for sports like walking, jogging, bicycling and roller skating etc. Although the parking is paid, nevertheless, park and beach are free for everyone. The views are really great, specially at sunrise and sunset.
18;Wonderful Park by the lake and Free Swimming!;My son and I went for a swim first in the lake, then in the pool. Even though the Pavilion is being renovated at the moment - the pool was still wonderful, free and worth the visit. [lockers just 25cents] Its incredibly close to Queen Street West [the Roncesvalles side] and was minutes away from our hotel. There was several dozen Dragon Boats out from the Sunnyside Paddling Club as well... it was great to watch them in action. I will be back!

19;Exploring Ontario Downtown Toronto;Didn't plan ahead. Should have set 200$ a day. It's expensive city, and not a lot to do, other than shop and drink...
19;Spectacular sunset views of iconic Toronto Skyline!;Cool place if you have some time to explore. We didn’t (much) so I decided to give it a 5 star, although I may have only given it a 1 or a 2. Why? It’s really dated, dirty and a little something out of American Horror Story, which some folks may like! <br><br>The best part is the iconic view of the city skyline. My recommendation would be to go, get some ice cream at the stand by the dock, nestle in and witness the sunset. As darkness falls the city slowly and magically lights up. With the reflection of the lights on the water it’s transformed into an ethereal place of beauty that will leave you breathless. Plus! You’ll get to take some truly amazing pictures that you’ll treasure. <br><br>Thus, the reason for the 5 star. If you’re planning a visit in summer or autumn bring bug spray, some bottled water and a blanket to sit on. I was eaten alive by mosquitoes, but the pictures we took were worth all of the itching and twitching the next day! <br><br>You know what they say: A picture is worth a thousand words :)
19;Great escape from the city heat;Easy ferry ride from Toronto. About 10 dollars one way and free the other. There are three linked islands with the main one having a large amusement park and an animal park. Plenty of places to eat and drink with great views of the Toronto skyline. We went on a hot day and it was cooler and more peasant than the city.
19;Really cool and eerie in winter;We went in the dead of winter, the place was borderline abandoned, and made for an incredible walk through the island. Still able to access the gardens, maze and pier, so lots to do for a cute little adventure. Lovely views of the city too. <br><br>Obviously nothing is open there so bring some water and snacks and your own bike if you feel like it.
19;Must do;It's worth a visit ,the ferry distance was very short only 15 minutes .<br>Very beautiful island with lots of things to do.we really loved the animal farm .
19;Loved the ferry ride;Loved the ferry ride to and from the islands. Walking around was nice - I should have brought my bike! All of the green space was just amazing
19;Great park;Great park to walk in a sunny day and have a picnic. Perfect spot for a picture of Toronto skyline. You can take the ferry or a taxi boat at harbour front.
19;Great spot for photographing the Toronto skyline;Unfortunately, I did not get to see this park in the daytime.  However, I did get over to it on the ferry after the evening sun had gone down.<br><br>My main purpose was to see what the Toronto skyline looked like from this park perspective.  <br><br>Here's a few photos of what I got.
19;Nice place, naff food.;We liked the islands, but the catering is abysmal. We queued for ages for pizza, there were only a few slices left (at lunchtime) and they were nearly cold (completely cold by the time we paid and sat down). Didn't seem to be any proper sit down restaurants, just naff kiosks with hardly any staff or actual food. <br><br>But bring a picnic and all will be perfect.
19;A slice of cottage country in the city;Fantastic archipelago with the best view of the skyline many lovely beaches, and cute little cottages! Highly recommend to anyone visiting Toronto!
19;Toronto Island was one of our favorite days of vacation in Toronto;We went on a summer Tuesday and could not get over the perfect, beautiful weather, amazing views of Toronto skyline, the gorgeous grounds. It was relaxing and unhurried, and not too crowded, comparatively speaking. We admired the geese, road a quadricycle, had a Beavertail pastry, walked around the amusement park/ petting zoo area and saw a Zebu. It was just beautiful and relaxing, and the ferry ride is short and smooth- no seasickness among us.
19;Awesome place and great view of the city;The island is awesome and there are plenty of things to do.  We took a bike ride around the island and went swimming.  Great way to spend the day and to see the skyline of Toronto
19;Busy, touristy;Wards beach was overcrowded, noisy, unsafe swimming due to ecoli. If someone so much as dipped a toe in the water the Nazi lifeguard would run down the beach shouting in her loud speaker at them. Ferry ride back was overcrowded and awkward.<br>
19;Clean, well maintained and landscaped park;Well maintained and landscaped park which is easily accessible by ferry from the Toronto HarbourFront district.  Bring some comfortable shoes since this is lots of walking paths.  Do note that on site food options are very limited so consider packing some snacks for the visit.  Also bring a camera and binoculars for stellar views of the Toronto walk front.  It can get windy at the southern beach.
19;Nirvana In Toronto;The Ferry ride over to the islands is great. The old ferries have ambiance, and you get stunning views of Toronto's skyline. Then the islands themselves offer lots of different features including beaches, forest, a little community of cottages and some canals and inlets with yacht clubs.

20;<span>Learn more</span> about animal welfare in tourism;A beautiful large park, with the cutest zoo for kids
20;What a beautiful park in the fall with the trees changing colours. The zoo was so cute, we saw a cababara, peacocks, emus, bisons, goats, lamas, among others. It took us a fair amount of wandering around to find it, there were no signs anywhere! I had heard that police were giving out tickets to bikers, which I thought odd, until we visited the park for the first time and many latex clad individuals raced past us going VERY fast. So many little kids tottering about, I’m surprised there not been more accidents. The bathroom were kinda gross too, but at least they were not locked.;Jamie Bell Adventure Playground
20;Spent a morning with friends and kids whilst visiting Toronto and the Adventure Playground was well worth the tram and bus ride to get there as kept the kids entertained for hours!;An urban oasis
20;Massive park with tons of things to do. Grenadier Pond is a must-see, very tranquil and serene. The best time to come is around April so you see the beautiful cherry blossoms. Great transport connections to the north, east, and south, and even a little trackless trolley that kids will love.;Great park with plenty of activites
20;What a massavie park.  There is so much to do and see here.  Loved seeing the Maple leaf out of flowers, they had a nice zoo and loved seeing all the dogs running free in the area.  This park has so much to offer!;Huge Park + Cherry Blossums every spring
20;nice for a day trip and walk-through. Huge location though so wear comfy walking shoes.  Many things to see including the trees, ponds and more.;Large park, very beautiful
20;<span>Learn more</span> about animal welfare in tourism;Great Park in a Deteriorating City
20;I've been going to High Park my whole life, although I haven't been there recently as I lived abroad for some time. I love this park. However, I feel that I must add to the comment about the disgusting toilet facilities. While I haven't experienced these particular washrooms lately, I have been in other ones in Toronto parks and they are disgusting, embarrassing really. I live in Port Credit and ride my bike a lot in both cities. There is a huge difference in washroom maintenance between the two cities: Mississauga cleans them. Toronto doesn't. This is inexcusable for Canada's "premier" city. If it's a matter of funding, then don't waste precious dollars on silly things like renaming Dundas Street when you can't afford to provide the basic amenities people should, and do, expect from their cities. It's not rocket science.;Enjoyable walk through the forest trails and by the lake
20;Over 50 walking trails, most zigzagging through the the forested areas. With the late warm spring weather, some of the trees and flowers are blossoming alter than normal.  We went on a weekday morning, to avoid the after-work and weekend crowds.;High park is definitely is one of my favourite parks in Toronto.
20;One of the best spots in the GTA. I love everything about this park. Loads of space for walking, playing or just a nice picnic. The kids playground is one of the best and the amenities are excellent. This would be my top choice.;Maple leaf 🍁 must!
20;We went specifically to see the flower bed in the shape of the maple leaf ! The park is fine for a walk .... beside the water is cool and it’s close to everything if you want to stop for a coffee or lunch. Won’t rush back but it was nice to visit.;Nesting great horned owls
20;We don't get to High Park often: from where we live it's out of the way. We went their yesterday on the invitation of a friend who is an avid birder and nature photographer. There is a nesting pair of great horned owls in the central western part of the park. After a short walk from the restaurant parking lot we saw a number of photographers aiming their telephoto lenses at a conifer, and with the aid of binoculars we soon saw the mother on the nest and the father in a nearby tree. We didn't see the two chicks: next time. Afterwards we drove down to the ponds in the southern part of the park and admired the ducks and a lone turtle sunning him or herself on a rock. Nice walks in beautiful late afternoon sunshine. Highly recommended, especially in this time of Covid!;A GREAT WALKING ADVENTURE IN THE CITY
21;Disasterous;Disaster ...dirty noisy bums homeless drugs feel unsafe...cringey...scared to go there ... Feels unsafe...not the same Toronto I loved and lived in for ALMOST 40 YEARS...thanks to COVID
21;Great !;We've visited Times Square and this place is much larger and better to be honest. Negative comments about "light pollution" show how crazy some people are.
21;Times square wannabe;This place always strikes me as a Times Square wannabe, but lacking the character of the real thing. It's always noisy and always chaotic feeling. Lots of screens, ads, noise, garbage, and street preachers with loudspeakers seem to be the main highlights of this place.<br><br>On the plus side, the square is right next to the Eaton centre which offers an orderly respite from the chaos going on outside.
21;Very good;It was a pleasure visiting and trip advisor helped us to pin point the places to be visited. All in all it was very helpful by trip advisor.
21;Like a mini Time Square in Toronto;If you like crowds, sounds, and lights, then this is for you.<br><br>If you hate it, then avoid this area, and I would also say avoid NYC and Vegas.<br><br>Every big city has its place of energy, and this is it.  Yes, lots of people, street performers, vendors selling trinkets, bars, restaurants, smell of weeds, you name it.  <br><br>Is it safe?  Every big city has crime.  But it's your own responsibility to stay safe and be alert of your own surroundings.  <br><br>Will I go to Dundas to hang out?  Of course!  There you'll feel the energy and heart beat of the city.  It's like Robson in Vancouver, Hollywood in LA, Time Square in NYC, Shibuya in Tokyo, Nathan in Hong Kong...  You have to experience it to feel it.
21;It’s crap. Skip it.;I remember when there were jean, jewelry and book stores here (man I’m old) and even though it was many years ago it was way better than this Time Square rip off. It’s not a horrible as NYC’s Time Square but it’s pretty close. They could have done better for a public space. It’s crap.
21;An okay photo opportunity;We did this with it being compared to Time Square in New York. <br><br>I'd say it's about 40% as good. During the day it really doesn't look that special. However, at night it's much better. <br><br>We passed through during a weekend concert and it had a really exciting vibe to the place. It felt inclusive and is worth a quick visit. <br><br>
21;great place;This square is a great place just to hang out and people watch. it's right by the Eaton's center and people just seem to hang there.  I was just at Rib Fest which they set up there and it was great.
21;Another Toronto photo opportunity;I walked by Yonge-Dundas Square during my visit to Toronto in April 2022.  It reminds me a little bit of Times Square in New York City with lights, screens, shops, restaurants.  I did not linger here.  I took a photo and moved on.  I will spend more time here during my next trip to Toronto and probably in the evening.
21;Not bad;Several events are hosted at this square throughout the year. Restaurants, bars, and a movie theatre are scattered around the square. In the summer, it can get very crowded with people watching live performers and musicians.
21;;
21;;
22;Worthy stop around dowtown.;An urban plaza with important buildings around like the Toronto City Hall. The surroundings seem to be maintained and it felt safe. The underground parking garage underneath the plaza is very convenient.
22;magnet;The large skating rink does attract many locals (and tourists) to test their abilities. Plenty of benches to sit a while and watch the world go by.
22;Really neat for Winter;Beautiful gathering area.   Huge skating area with eateries around.  Lots of fun to just hang out.  It is always interesting to me what sticks with you about trips.  We were waiting in line to get skates and there was a city manager leaning against the wall smoking.  Directly behind her was a sign that read, smoking strictly prohibited in the area with a big fine.  I almost got a pic but she noticed my wife's and I looking and laughing and put her cigarette out and go inside.
22;Nice rink with a few downsides;The size is great. However, it can get crazily crowded every single day in the evening. The ice is rough even after maintaining.
22;Lively public square!;The square is full of life year round. I visited in winter, at which time there was a public skating rink and a night market with vendors selling traditional foods from various regions in the world. But it is used for many events all year round.<br><br>Having the iconic Toronto city hall buildings (both the old one, and the new one) in the background as well as excellent public lighting and decorations makes Nathan Phillips square an easily identifiable landmark downtown. Worth stopping by for great pictures and fun when events are on.
22;Not an Absolute Must-See;This is a nice little area to stop at to take pictures with the Toronto sign if you have time. When we visited, the fountain and lights were all off so it was nothing spectacular. I probably would only recommend going if you are in the area/passing by. Not something to go out of your way for.
22;Fab square;Great square and great to see the Toronto sign, area somewhat let down by the amount of homeless people around, and also rats! not a goos look for tourists
22;Nice Square;Photo-op central with 3 interesting places all in one location (City Hall, Old City Hall, Toronto Sign). There's probably even more we didn't know about. Close to Eaton Centre and Yonge-Dundas Square.
22;Pretty place to spend a little time;The fountain is nice  and the Toronto sign is a great photo op.  Comfy place to sit and watch the world go by.
22;Okay for pictures;Just a place for a good photo opt. There is very little room to get a good picture because of the way the Toronto sign is facing. Not much else there.
22;Diversity on display.;The square is a beautiful celebration of diversity, contemporary architecture set against old buildings. The atmosphere was celebratory. As an African I loved the designs included in the Toronto letters.  Good afternoon trip - a tourist site, but don’t miss it.
22;One of the few FREE attractions worth visiting.;In Toronto there is plenty to do. Always has been, always will be. Most everything costs money, lots of it, but Nathan Philips Square doesn’t cost anything and it’s a nice visit. In the winter there is (or at least was) skating on the ice. You can check it out as it’s a nice stop to chill at and relax until the weather is extremely adverse. Even then it might work.
23;good on Easter weekend;Went on the long weekend as everything else was closed for the Holidays.  It was great to see the place opened.  It wasn't too busy and the parking was really cheap and underneath the building at 10 bucks.   Manged to buy a few things before everything closed. Very difficult to get a seat in the food court.
23;Good food court;This place has some good shops and it's a nice walk around.<br>A good variety of food options in the food court.<br>Sadly no options for more affordable shopping.
23;Great Shopping Mall!;CF Toronto Eaton Centre is one busy shopping mall! This mall offers a large selection of shops and brands across 4-storeys and a massive food court in the basement. And the architecture is something else!
23;Big mall;Very big shopping mall, one can easily lose the way inside. Many products and brands. The eateries is at the basement if you are looking for cheap eats.
23;Shoppers delight;Always spend an hour browsing this super mall. Very bright, well-maintained mall on 3 floors of shopping / food outlets. Always worth a visit.
23;Big but nothing special;It is just another mall, same stores as every other mall. The food court does not have enough seating and is loud and crowded.
23;Must see ⬇️;Eaton Centre is located underground, with about 5 levels! It is incredibly vast, and designed magnificently! The stores all high quality, great for relaxing, dining, and even just window shopping! Eaton Centre offers a large scale of things to do, eat, dine, shop, read - you name it! There is a large selection of shops for you to choose from, so if you are looking for something good to take home, don’t worry, I assure you you won’t leave empty handed! Every shop I walked into was unique and special! It is a great tourist attraction, and I can tell why - it’s great to go to for any occasion with anyone, friends and family! There’s live music (at certain times) which is always fun to listen to while walking by, and I am truly in awe with the way they decorated it! If you are traveling, or if you just want a place to hang out, come to Eaton Centre… you won’t be disappointed.
23;Nice but pricey.. bring your wallet!;I was able to find a few things that suited my taste and were affordable during my time shopping at the eaton centre. There’s quite a variety of clothing stores and a food court with great food as well.
23;The busiest mall in North America for good reason!;One of my favourite places to just go for a walk around in Toronto. Massive atrium lets in tons of natural light, and the fibreglass birds are a nice touch. Lots and lots of different stores to choose from, everything from clothes to tech to books to shoes to food! Tons of places to sit and people watch. Super easy access at both ends to two subway stations and two streetcar lines. Many parking levels that rarely fill up if you're coming by car. Very centrally located in the downtown and right beside City Hall/Nathan Phillips Square. Not the biggest mall but certainly the best.
23;Clean and Not Too Crowded;What a big place but still just an average shopping mall. All the regular stores and restaurants. It is definitely nice and clean. Not too crowded but we went on a weekday around lunch time.
23;Large mall in central Toronto;Lots of stores, tall ceilings, interesting food court.  If you’re from somewhere that has large malls, this one isn’t terribly difference.   If you’re not, worth a visit if you enjoy a well-equipped mall.
23;Very nice shopping mall;I visited Eaton Centre several times during my Toronto trip in April 2022.  It is a nice place to walk around and window shop.  I enjoyed especially Indigo Books.  I wore my mask here.
23;We never miss it;We’ve been to this mall several times and are always impressed with it. They have a 100% mask mandate fior the mall. This large, indoor shopping mall is located right in the heart of Toronto. They have everything from smaller retail shops to larger department stores. The food court has anything your stomach could desire. However, their is limited food court seating due to Covid restrictions. Security was checking proof of vaccination and government ID.
23;Nice Shopping Centre;Always come to the eaton centre when I visit the city, has everything you need from pharmacies, sport shops, gadget stores from Bell to Apple and more.
23;Pretty mall, but issues with parking;Very beautiful mall. Although it is very overwhelming and stuffy, it has a great selection of stores.<br><br>Big issue with parking though, almost impossible to park here without dropping over 20 bucks just to walk around a mall!!
23;;
24;A shadow of its former self.;A once bustling place, there are only a handful of businesses trading here, which is a pity as it’s in a great place on the waterfront. Even some of the bars had started trading for the winter, even though when we were there in early October the waterfront area was busy. Disappointing.
24;Good for a Stroll;Walk from the Ferry terminal  along the harbour front, very relaxing with some good views across to the Islands
24;An ideal location;ideal location to shoot the sunset. This area gives you an awesome sensation of peace. Good and clean seating areas, long path along the seashore. surrounded by numerous food stands so you may satisfy your hunger while travelling. facilitated by a broad runway at Billy Bishop Airport and a water taxi.
24;Very nice environment;Very nice location along the waterfront. Often it hosts events and lives music in a fantastic environment.
24;Great walk;Lovely area to walk and see the water. Good places to eat and site as well. There is however no walk to distillery area along harbor as heads up.
24;great views;This is a great spot just to walk around and unwind. it's in the Core of downtown and has coffee shops and restaurants.
24;;
24;;
24;;
24;;
24;;
25;Poor overall;Hard to find and even then just a couple of streets with many run-down exteriors. Often the shops don't open until 11.00 as well adding to the disappointment.
25;Fun afternoon;I went by myself and just wandered and checked out the shops. My favorite was the spice shop!! I loved it!! Bought a bunch!
25;Street art is the main attraction;The walls are painted with street art, some are pretty, some are a bit hard to appreciate. The shops looked rundown from the exterior.
25;A cute little neighborhood;Such an amazing place to be, one of my favorite place in Toronto. Very pretty neighborhood, with a lots of little second hands stores. Lots of little boutique and restaurants.
25;OMG;What a dumpster fire that was. A disgusting unkept smelly place- worst area of the city with absolutely nothing to offer.
25;Over Rated;Kind of a dump. I get the so-called bohemian vibe, but too gritty for my taste. There are a few good coffee shops and a bakery, but the overall experience was shabby.
25;Small Market;Maybe I came at it from the wrong angle and missed something of the area but the market I walked into was small and not much to see (we have a bigger, nicer market at home). <br>It was maybe 3 rows of small grocers and food places, a couple of tourist stalls and that was it. Took me 5mins to walk around then turned and walked back!
25;Not what we expected ...;Not all all what we expected with all the hype.  We actually felt unsafe ... the place reeked of weed and urine, very dirty streets, the shops were nothing special ... teeshirts, trinkets and very few interesting things. I thought it was going to be more green grocers, cheese shops, bakeries, etc., but we didn't see anything that we wanted to purchase (or even browse). Lot of very stoned people hanging out. Not someplace I would head back to.
25;Don’t bother;This place is not very nice at all!! It’s dirty, rubbish everywhere and the ‘shops’ are thrift shops and if that’s your thing then great. Not for us
25;Do not go on a Monday!!;We stopped by on a Monday and it was obviously garbage night. Even though it was afternoon every single business had piles and piles of garbage out front. The smell was horrible and it obviously looked terrible as well. Did not leave a good impression. I’m sure any other day would be fine.
25;Market stroll;Tons of small food establishments. We parked on the main road and walked in. Each of us were able to grab food and we sat in the park.
25;Dirty, smelly, uncomfortable;Has potential but it's extremely dirty, smelly, too many junkies around. I don't get why it's a big thing, it's so uncomfortable to walk around.
26;A Chic, Modern and HIGH End Shopping Centre;A very chic and modern high-end shopping mall. If you're looking for luxury brands like Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Prada, Burberry, Chanel, etc., this is the mall! Easily accessible off the freeway with ample parking and a movie theatre. A great mall to spend an afternoon of shopping.
26;Was pick pocketed here;There are pick pockets in the mall food court. I went there, and while waiting in the Chipotle line, my backpack was opened up and a charger code was stolen. This occurred with a food court packed with people. I did feel some tugging on my bag, but I thought someone was bumping me from behind as the food court was super crowded.  Well never again will I wear a backpack to go shopping there. I've been to the Eaton Centre and never been robbed.  Beware of your surroundings at all times. Due to the crowded nature of the mall, it would be very easy to have your wallet or purse stolen without you even realizing it.<br><br>As an aside, the food court is way too small for all the people who use it. It should be about 3-4 times the size that it currently is. You have to luck out to get a seat.
26;Unpleasant;I must say of all the stores I have visited at Yorkdale,  Zara is the worst for customer service.   No one ever on the floor to help.
26;Great mall with annoying background music.;Great shopping mall, but the background music is always a very annoying jazzy music. Now they are playing jazzy Christmas music - even more annoying!!! :(<br>Easy to get to and very good free parking. :)
26;Yorkdale is a 5/10;There are many stores to shop, especially if you are interested for high end brands. But, I will most likely not go there if I’m not buying anything. There are very few chairs to sit if you get tired. It’s super crowded. It’s giving me headache to stroll. Had dinner at Cheesecake Factory that was an hour and a half wait. Nothing to do at the mall except find a chair to sit on.
26;Nicest mall in North America;Beautiful. Everything you can imagine. ALL of the high end brands. Good food options and easy parking.  All the stores are at least two stories high.
26;No regard for physically challenged shoppers.;As a challenged person on permanent oxygen and with limited mobility, I was shocked to learn after parking in underground Access parking and taking escalators to the west side of the mall level, the only Customer Service booths are located on the east side of the mall. I went to purchase Gift Cards, needed them for a next day event and therefore couldn't do an online purchase. After considering my options, I walked the length of the mall to make my purchase. A foolish decision as a day later I'm still physically suffering from the effort. It behooves me to understand why such a reputable mall wouldn't offer Customer Service at critical entry points. It is also beyond comprehension that their level of service for challenged shoppers ends with a few Access parking spots.
26;Shopping, dining, and visiting an exhibition within the mall;Nice mall, with a good collection of stores. Not overly large. Easy to get to and lots of parking. It keeps being upgraded.
26;Most terrible mall in Canada;Terrible experience. So packed and it took us over an HOUR to get out of the parking lot. Poor planning on all parts. Don’t waste your time
26;New stores and galleries;Always find new stores during visits.There are 2 new galleries too.Lots of merchandises.Kind of have to know what you are getting and proceed to find the items.The mall is quite big and can easily be distracted by the sheer number of stores.
27;Ihave worked in an Institution whereby I have been doing the same job for some time until COVID-19.	Ihave experience of more than ten years and I love house keeping very much ,So if given the job am sure I will do if perfectly.

27;just admiring the shops;If coming downtown Toronto it's worth visiting Yorkville for the fine dining and the shops. A little pricy but its a nice stroll to walk around.
27;For tourists and (maybe) people looking for brands;I'm sorry, gone are the days. IN MY OPINION, there are so many other areas in Toronto for tourists that are more interesting to shop and eat . Queen and King West, for example, both have a greater range of fashion stores and restaurants. Maybe a quick visit if you have to have couturier fashion (and a visit to the ROM and the Gardiner Museum, but that's something different.)
27;Cute area of Toronto, overpriced;Yorkville is known for being super expensive/high end and it is, but it's also nice for a walk around and a sweet treat on an afternoon.

27;Stylish Neighborhood;In January we stayed in a hotel around the vicinity of Yorkville Village.The neighborhood has chic cafes and bars and fine-dining restaurants. I understand its posh hotels host Hollywood insiders during the Toronto International Film Festival. The three main museums namely Royal Ontario Museum, Gardiner and Bata Shoe Museum are all located in this neighborhood which makes this area really one of the best place to visit in Toronto.
27;Tourists and locals unite;Yorkville is the place to be in summer-fall, and you don’t have to break the bank. It’s easy to find from Bay Subway Station (NW side) or the municipal parkade at 158 Cumberland. Street entertainers perform outside Starbucks or Kupfert & Kim on weekends. Drinks are also available at Dave Rocco Bar Aperitivo 97 Cumberland or at KungFu Bubble Tea (Grapefruit Green) downstairs /kitty corner to there. and Italian (Coco espresso, Sassafraz, Vaticano or Cibo further along Bellair Street) offer food for open-air dining. Ethnic table-service options are plentiful along Yorkville Avenue. Finish off gelato & Scream ice cream or try decadent desserts near boutique alley (opposite Hazelton Ave), perpendicular to Cumberland. The rectangular map-village walk is a spectacle of glamour, youthful Joie de vivre and colour-popping stops for the senses.
27;Really worth it;Was so much fun! Definitely worth seeing! Beautiful cafes, restaurants, and a lot of fun! Nice walk and very fashionable. Very expensive

27;Great for a stroll!;Yes it has many expensive boutiques, but it is one of the nice places in Toronto for a stroll any time of the day or evening. In February it hosts a great ice sculpture contest, while in the summer time (end of June) it has a wonderful free jazz festival that I encourage all music enthusiasts to check out. There are also many great cafes and restaurants for good food and for people watching!

27;IceFest in Yorkville village;Celebrate winter with the annual Bloor-Yorkville Icefest throughout the Village of Yorkville Park and surrounding area A free public event, patrons can expect a wide variety of uniquely designed ice sculptures and amazing winter activities for the duration of the weekend in February. The best time to visit is after sunset. 127 Cumberland St, Toronto, ON M5S 2W7
28;Winter visit to Toronto;The old city Hall is one of the nicest landmark of the economic capital of Canada. <br>You will never get lost by using it as the center of your walks and strolls. Its belltower can be heard every hour, at night too, and is so nice to hear the bell!
28;A cool historic building;Although it was very cold outside it was worthwhile coming to see this grand piece of Toronto's history
28;Excellent;Great for architecture lovers with a very interesting facade. At a busy intersection and very prominent. Do go and check it out !
28;Awesome place;What a neat place.  The photos outside are beautiful.  It is an active courthouse now, so no pictures inside but the outside of it is great for photos.
28;Good photo opportunity;I walked past the Old City Hall several times during my visit to Toronto in April 2022.  It was a great photo opportunity.  It is located near the New City Hall and the Eaton Centre.  The architecture is very interesting.
28;Beautiful architecture;Beautiful building. Beautiful architecture. I only saw it during the day, but I've read that it is even more beautiful at night. Can't wait to come back and confirm it by myself.
28;Pic opportunity;Not worth going out of your way, but a good photo opportunity. This 1900s building is iconic and really nice when - luckily for us - the sun broke through a wintry sky.
28;Nice walk;Even when temperature is really low, it is a must go visit in Toronto. There is a lot of shopping opportunities around and very good food.
28;Very festive;Christmas market was very good and I enjoyed watching all the people skating on the ice rink. Plenty of great food trucks at reasonable prices.
28;Big Toronto Sign;I suppose this big TORONTO represents you are in the middle of a beautiful city. Hard to get a selfie without anyone in it. The City Hall was not opened on the weekend. I went on to Eaton Center where people do their shopping and pick up some nice food in the cafe.or in the food court.
28;Architecturally Beautiful;The Old City Hall which is now a courthouse is architecturally beautiful and a must visit for any traveler in Toronto. Could not visit inside as it was closed for Canada Day. Certainly worth a photo stop.
28;great greek food;You can't go wrong for greek food, plenty of fine restaurants to choose from, my fave is Astoria's on danforth. And the shopping during the day is amazing too.
29;Doors Open, a lot to see, did not disappoint;This was first on our list for day 1 of Doors Open Toronto weekend (May 28-29) and it did not disappoint.  The Ontario Legislative Building has an impressive facade--we cannot help but spend a few minutes outside and take photos of it and some of the monuments and memorials in Queen's Park. Building entrance is on the south side where everyone has to go through airport-style screening complete with walk-through metal detector and x-ray scanner. Expect visible security presence, tour route directional signs and cordoned off areas. <br><br>The self-guided tour took us from the first floor of the east wing, up the stairs to the second floor then inside the iconic Legislative Chamber and the Lieutenant Governor's Suite and finally to the west wing. There was definitely a lot to see and staff was on hand to answer any questions from visitors. Photography is allowed.<br><br>Some of the things to see inside the Legislative Building:<br>The east wing's elegant oak floors and panels versus the newer west wing's cold marble floors and pillars - both are stunning but I like wood better<br>Portraits of Ontario Premiers - current Premier Doug Ford will only get his after he is out of office<br>Class pictures of all Ontario MPPs since the 1st Parliament <br>Legislative Chamber -mostly off-limits - visitors can only look at the Chamber from inside the main doors<br>Lieutenant Governor's Suite - lovely, elegantly furnished room - staff told us the carpet is entirely in one piece and had to be brought in through the windows. staircase full of portraits reminded me of museums<br>Ontario coat of arms on the stained glass ceiling in the west wing<br><br>We spent about an hour inside the building and we did not even look at everything. From the east wing, the tour ends at the lobby right in front of the cordoned off grand staircase. Exit is at the front doors directly facing University Ave.<br><br>Note: FREE guided tours are offered year-round. Advance registration required.
29;Excellent free tour - impressive building;We booked a free tour online around 1 hour ahead. There was loads of availability, with 15 spaces per 30 minute  tour. Staff were really friendly. You have to clear security and bring ID with you. Our tour guide was excellent, very knowledgeable.  It was an excellent activity on a rainy morning in Toronto. The building itself is very impressive inside and out and we learned a great deal about the traditions and process of law making in Ontario.
29;Wish it was open;Unfortunately, I was only able to see it from the outside, because the building was closed due to Labor day. I can say for sure that it looks great (again) from the outside and I can't wait to see it when I come back to Toronto.
29;government building with great architecture;Again, a really cool building if you're into architecture and want to be able to go through, walking the grounds and hanging out with a coffee is pretty nice too
29;Wish We Could Have Entered the Building;We walked all around the beautiful grounds, but alas we were there on a Saturday and couldn't enter the building.
29;Interesting history;We were like many who could not initially gain access as we had no photo ID so had to come back later. Tours are free so you cannot complain and last about half an hour. You are restricted on where you can go but on the day we visited there was no sitting so we were lucky to go into the actual chamber.<br>Plenty of information was given about the parliamentary process and the history of the building as we moved around, explaining about the new and old parts of the building, pre and post fire.<br>Definitely worth a visit
29;Old Glory Still in Fashion.;Same era and style as Toronto Old City Hall and the Parliament Buildings. Heritage that can not be replaced.
29;Historic building, good information about government decision making process;You can book a visit and also without booking, attend a question period in the House. Be sure to check whether the House is in session and the time of the question period. There are many plaques and items helping you understand the history and current process better.
29;Nothing Special;Impressed that how the main road leading up to the building goes from a built up area and into an open space, the building itself is nothing special as there are far better ones.
29;Boring single parliament building.;Can not think of a more boring government building to visit.<br>But it is a popular spot for protesters.
29;Ontario Legislative Building, Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Must visit to appreciate this building.  Offers tours every half hour.  No need to reserve just show up and book on the spot. Read up on the history of this great building!
29;my first time here;I went here with my female partner (from HK) and my Asian grandson.He was interested in the junior school tour program and easter egg hunt to learn about parliment.We joined the kids tour of the facility and I was impressed with the archtecture of the building and the history behind.I am glad I went there although a lot of walking.parking was close buy and entry was free.I recommend PH
30;Very characterful;Its great that this old place is still in use with its characterful interior that - with the numbers of passengers milling around - is hard to really appreciate !
30;Loved business class trip TO to Montreal;Beautiful station, especially the business lounge.   First time taking train in Canada and everything was great.  Business class was very good: Very comfortable lounge, walked straight onto train.  4 and half hour journey to Montreal passed easily with frequent drink, meal and snack service.
30;Great station;Union Station is really nice. Clean, free wifi, lots of places to eat and drink in the York Concourse. Has lots of transit options, including long distance trains (via rail), commuter trains(go train), go buses, the ttc, and the UP Express which is great for getting to Pearson Airport. Overall, it's a great station.
30;Nice station but not really an attraction.;Toronto Union station is old and historic. You’ve even seen it perhaps in the The Last Detail or first X-Men movies but that was a while ago…<br><br>It’s a transportation hub for the city and has just finished some major renovations. I didn’t even recognize most of it, certainly not the underground portion. It’s an improvement and they kept most of the historic look in the main hall, but I miss the Harvey’s.<br><br>If you’re into old buildings and architectural there is some appeal here, if not avoid it during rush hour if you can. It’s a sea of commuters the morning and evening.
30;Easy to navigate;This is the main hub for subways and trains. This is a pretty good station to get around and it’s easier to navigate. The station announcements are multilingual in both French and English. The building is handicapped accessible, including elevators. For any coffee lovers out there, they have a Starbucks. On the lower level, theirs a food court. While waiting to board my train, I took advantage all the charging stations offered here. The WIFI was better than we thought. Still a great way to get back and forth between cities.
30;Terrible health precautions during covid;These guys do not take covid seriously, the receptionist had her mask off when I went in and the manager is rude! The least you would expect from a business class lounge is manners!
30;Needs Better Signage;In all fairness the place is under renovations right now, however, the signage is not listed out very well. If you aren’t from the area you would have a hard time finding out where to go. I would have rated it lower, however there were some really friendly police officers and construction workers that gave me perfect directions. Too bad the actual staff couldn’t do that.
30;Travel made easy;I spend so much time traveling to Toronto for medical care and I can always find a friendly staff person whether it is VIA Rail, GoTrain, TTC or any of the services available!<br>Thanks so much for taking the time!<br>Regards, Denis
30;A renovation nightmare;Ah Union station is such a beautiful old building. The last 2 times I've been there it has been a nightmare negotiating the stairs, hall etc. There are barely any signs to let you know where to go etc. Sad really
30;Main arrival station for trains to Toronto;The main hall is an historic and well-maintained, pleasing-to-the-eye room. Not the wow factor of New York's but still very good. Could have had more signage for the exits.
30;Historic building. Go check out the historic building, it’s a great way to spend some time looking at everything and there are plenty of food choices to make
30;Very useful;Very well suited, easy to navigate, well priced. People working here were very kind and helpful. I will recommend this service, fast and efficient.
