1;Very interesting;Lovely to have a tour without the crowds which enabled one to appreciate its beauty.  The hand held guided talk was very good
1;Poor information, a lot of moneys;We had a tour in this place . Information was provided poorly. We were informed that we have to pay top price to visit palace and gardens, but access to gardens was free. We also were informed that tour in English language starts in 1.5 hour, we’re we waited and wasted, because tour  could be started anytime, because it actually provided by electronic hearing devices.
1;Amazingly beautiful!;Amazingly beautiful palace, worth the money you pay. Stunning, magnificent, truly royal. We got audioguide in Ukrainian language which is quite rare to find.<br><br>The only thing is: it is forbidden to make photos in the palace ( so, of course, we have not), but many people do and nobody cares. The same with smoking in the gardens. I just do not understand why to forbid things if they do not have enough staff to control that these rules are obeyed to,  It would be fair thast either nobody gets photos or everybody does.
1;And amazing experience, but the ticketing is confusing;The palace and gardens are truly remarkable. It is an amazing setting and lovely to explore. The ticketing system is confusing and haphazard. Surely it could be simplified.
1;Audio guide included in the ticket price;Took the Grand Tour of Schönbrunn Palace in early March 2023. An audio guide is included in the ticket price. Ornate interiors. No photographs allowed. After the tour, I strolled through Schönbrunn Palace Park. It was a cold, cloudy day with light rain. No garden or water features during the winter.
1;10/10;Got the grand tour as part of the Vienna flexi pass. When we went to get tickets (prepaid with the pass) they said we couldn't enter for two hours because it was busy that day. Minor inconvenience we returned at our designated time and it was worth the wait. We were given audio guides in English which was helpful. Top tip: the gardens are free to enter and walk around and are very large so if you have to wait for your tour time I'd highly recommend walking through the gardens. We went when the weather was a bit cold and very rainy but it was still beautiful. Tip: no backpacks allowed and there was a long queue for the cloakroom so either don't bring a rucksack or get there early and expect to have to wait a while.
1;Good but not great;We held a lot of hope for visiting this beautiful palace, but truth be told I don’t think it lived up to the hype. It was easy to get to on the metro from the centre of town, and I expect the gardens would be lovely to walk around for free in the summer. But in the winter, the gardens were quite bleak and the Christmas market wasn’t as good as others in town, so all that was left was the tour of the palace. We did the imperial tour (the shorter one) and from arriving at the main gate to doing the tour, and all there was to see and hear in the audioguide, only took us about an hour. We stayed a bit longer to look round the Christmas market and have some lunch, but it felt like quite a short visit to say you have to travel out of the centre for it. The palace itself was incredibly busy, so it felt more like a slow moving queue the whole way around. It was possible to visit with our baby in his buggy, but we were asked to carry it up the stairs as the wait for the lift was very long with just disabled people. This was fine for us, but may be a struggle for others with bigger prams. It was absolutely worth booking ahead though, as the ticket office queue when we arrived at 11.30 was massive. By 2pm when we were feeding our baby in the cafe by the ticket desk there was no queue at all and there were still tour times available, so if you’re going to walk-up make sure it’s at the end of the day. Mentioning food/drink, the cafe by the ticket office was not very good or not friendly so I would recommend avoiding it. The lunch we had at Cafe Residentz however was nice, so worth possibly waiting for a table there if you’re staying for food or drink.
1;Beautiful, here’s a few tips;This place is amazing but here are a few tips.  Even with Vienna pass you need to go to the ticket booth prior to entry to exchange for a paper ticket by time.  Go early because you may have a long wait prior to entry. We went on a rainy day with light crowds and had to wait 1 hour and 45 minutes.  There  are many other attractions to see on the grounds while you wait.  The strudel show was fun, go to the cafe in between the ticket booth and main entrance to the exhibit.  You can not take pictures inside.  The audio tour was great.
1;Our number one site to visit in Vienna. We spent 6 hours there and found it to be very worthwhile and enjoyable for the whole fa;3 generations visited this magnificent palace. In addition to myself my daughter and her husband were their 11 and 8 year old sons. <br>My complaint was the difficulty finding some of the things. The maps did not show where the maze was and the children wanted to see that first. We finally resorted to Google directions. You go in the back of the palace and walk towards the giant fountain. Partway there on your right between 2 statues is a recess with a sign that says maze labyrinth. The family enjoyed it although some areas had big puddles from the rain. There is also a children's playground that they both enjoyed and rest rooms.<br>The palace was magnificent.  Please be advised no backpacks or umbrellas are allowed on the tour, but there is a place to check them. We bought complete tickets but the strudel making closes admission 30 minutes before the final presentation which we missed by a few minutes.<br>This zoo has pandas. The best place to eat at the palace is an 18th century building in the center of the zoo that was a breakfast site for the royal family. You can get real meals there and the food was very good. The prices are better than the other restaurants and you can sit inside. It says they have wifi, but we were unable to get wifi the day we visited. <br>We were disappointed the books they had in the gift shop did not have the pictures we wanted to purchase and another tourist made the same comment in disappointment. <br>We purchased 2 books of photos when we visited the palacevin Madrid that we have shared with a lot of people and expected the same kind of publication. <br>The full tour was well worth the money and we recommend visitors buy tickets that cover everything<br> <br>
1;Huge Palace;Schonbrunn Palace is a vast building surrounded by gardens with varying uses. The entry fee for a tour of the state rooms was 20 euro which entitles you to an audio device or a booklet (but not both). The tour is limited to several rooms which give a feel for the palace as a whole. Unless you are really into its history a long guided tour could be exhausting. Interior photography is not permitted.<br>The palace grounds are free to visit in most places and the Gloriette Hill provides a magnificent view of the palace and Vienna. It also has a nice little restaurant which is worth dropping in.<br>The palace is next to the train station. It was surprising how packed the palace was for a weekday. It could be a nightmare at busy times.
1;Quite impressive;Schonbrunn is absolutely massive, you have to book a time slot for the grand tour. I think it depends on previous experience but although the ceilings are quite impressive the rooms are quite sparse with mainly tables and chairs set up as sitting rooms. I'm glad we visited but I'm not sure I would go again.
1;Easter market 2023 on grounds of Palace;Easter market was so charming. It’s in the grounds of the palace. Foods available and a manual merry-go-round. Sadly we got there as they were closing , but it’s really cute and well manned
1;Dress as a princess !;Fantastic place - plan and book your visit in advance - the grand tour was spectacular and in the children’s museum you get to dress up as princes and princesses ! This entertained my 10  and . 13 year olds for at least 1.5 hours ! The maze was also a fun family competition !
1;Imperial extravaganza;Pay attention now : if you have a Vienna pass you need to walk into the building where the hop on bus stops, you will get a ticket with a time on it. Don’t go into the palace without it, you won’t get in and have to go back. We did the Imperial audio tour, very interesting. Gardens are free, huge and amazing, you can also go up the Gloriette with your Vienna pass for amazing views. We had lunch at Cafe Landtmann in the grounds, finished off a great trip.
2;<span>Learn more</span> about animal welfare in tourism;Oldest zoo - lovely !
2;This zoo is excellent -<br>Great exhibits, variety of animals  and . lovely grounds.  Attached to gardens of palace<br>;Wonderful family experience
2;Oldest and extremely well made zoo where you and your kids will love to wander around with smiles all the way. This is a prime example of a zoo where you can see that animals have space to prosper.;Enjoyed it
2;Really enjoyed our visit, there are lots of different animals although there were some that were not out because it was so cold. You could easily spend hours here.;Amazing experience
2;Visited because I knew the have programs for endangered species and works with many animal protection organizations .The Pandas were a little shy, but it was a true privilege and a dream came true by seeing one. Small issue for me was the animal feeding times as the announcements are in German;An amazing zoo to visit!
2;An unbelievable experience at Schönbrunn Zoo, when visiting Vienna. And a must-have on your travel itinerary! A to Z of animals to see, from every continent around the world and of course, being one of 27 worldwide zoos to have the giant panda as an attraction. A true wonderous privilege to see in person!;The place to be!
2;We visited twice in 2021 and 2022, with 2 kids (5-9). The atmosphere of the Zoo is royal, as it was an "Animal garden" for the royal family. The highlight is of course the Koalas and the Pandas. They are just adorable! We found new friends in the Zoo - two Hyppos! They are sooo cute, they swim in an inside room, and you can observe them for hours.;Amazing
2;Learn more</span> about animal welfare in tourism;One of the best zoos I've visited
2;I love animals and I try to visit zoos in the cities I travel to. Vienna Zoo is definitely one of the best zoos I've ever visited. It has places to eat, different zones with animals and you can easily spend 4+ hours there.;Nice day
2;The zoo is well maintained, it has many animals and the paths are well marked. You can easily spend a day without getting bored<br> Attending the feeding of the sea seals is must as it is a great show. Disappointing but might be better in Summer/Spring
2;Visited as part of a Palace/Zoo package on a cold December day. The zoo is the oldest in the world and some areas are very old and rundown and need upgrading. Many of the animals are bored and it is sad to see them that way. There are newer exhibits and that is a good thing. The zoo also looks very dull and sad during winter but that is Europe winter for you. We spent about 2 hours but did miss one section, but the cold was too much for us.;Amazing!
2;Wonderful place to see and enjoy if you are an animal lover. You literally can touch and have close contact with animals.;A fantastic zoo
2;It is a fantastic zoo with a large array of animals.<br><br>There were lots of animals out even though it was cold.<br><br>The zoo is very ineratcive. We got to see tigers being fed, which was great.<br><br>The signs are clear, but the map helps a lot, too.<br><br>This is the world's oldest zoo, and it is in great shape still with lots of interesting animals.<br><br>This is free on vienna pass;Perfect day
2;Best zoo ever! Maybe bring your own food as food is expensive and we had to wait a long time for a table as their central cafe. The animals seem well looked after and there was so much to see.;Better than you can imagine
3;Nice vintage wheel, lacking a slight view!;It is a great ferris wheel and a must do as it is a landmark of the city. It’s also been used in many films including James Bond. The view isn’t that impressive to be fair but it’s nice being in such a traditional ferris wheel. If you are a couple you will be with others as it fits around 12 people but you will be walking around looking at views from all angles. But when in Vienna…
3;Great view;I'm not sure what I was expecting and yes it's a great view but it's one very slow ride, it stops at every car to let people on and you only go round once and that's it, over before you know it.
3;Centrepiece of the Christmas market;My twin brother Stephen and I were in Vienna in the run up to the Christmas period and we visited Prater ,the famous Viennese amusement park to enjoy the famous Prater Christmas Market and the centrepiece of this Christmas market is Wiener Riesenrad,this is the beautiful big wheel.<br>Wiener Riesenrad (  Vienna Giant Wheel ) is just stunning to view ,designed by British engineers Harry Hitchins and Hubert Cecil Booth and constructed by British engineer Lieutenant Walter Bassett Bassett in 1897 ,it was built to coincide with the Golden Jubilee of Franz Josef I and was one of the first Ferris wheels ever constructed .<br>This big wheel looked amazing when we visited and very popular indeed ,loved it ,great views and it was great taking in the great views of the Christmas market afforded for the big wheel ,if you're planning on visiting Vienna then a trip to Prater and the Wiener Riesenrad is highly recommended.
3;Great;A world-class city. fabulous food/shopping/sites. Don’t miss the Sacher hotel (home of the torte), at least one of the plethora of coffee houses, the Spanish Riding School, and some chamber music. The Ferris wheel has some history to it, situated in the middle of a modern amusement park which can be extremely crowded.
3;Iconic historical landmark and grand views;We make it an annual tradition over Christmas to take a ride on this famous historical landmark and it's always great fun. <br><br>The ride lasts around 20mins and is worth the entry fee. <br><br>The views are great although it's a distance from most other major landmarks so you'll need a good camera to take decent photos.<br><br>The queue in summer months can be quite long but just plan for that - it's still worth the wait. In the off season in December there's hardly a line at all so straight on board.<br><br>The fairground surrounding Reisenrad is totally kitch but nostalgic, and the kids will absolutely love it!
3;Iconic;Off-season in early December there was no queue, so we were able to board very quickly. Iconic ride for those who remember "The Third Man", and great views of the city.
3;A view from the top;A classic film location, a great Ferris wheel, a taste of classic Vienna…<br>What more do you need for such a competitive price.<br>With a little museum at the beginning and a 20 minute ride time it’s definitely worth a detour from the centre of town.
3;Disappointing;I was looking forward to riding this famous Ferris Wheel.  The view was very nice but you could not classify it as a ride.  You got on and as expected stopped as everyone else got on the other cars.  Once every car was full and you came back to the beginning it was time to get off!  How disappointing!  There was no going around a second or even a third time without stopping.
3;View from above!;This is the number one "activity" in Prater. <br>We made arrangements in order to have the ride with the famous Ferris wheel early evening in order to see Vienna from above at night. <br>Nice was also to see the small museum with miniatures showing Vienna the old times and the shop buying your photo prior entering the wheel.
3;Fun place for kids and adults;Apart from the famous Ferris Wheel, there are many attractions, especially for kids. We had little time to spend there, but the food was decent too.
3;Traditional ride at a historic park;This is a leisurely ride, that allows superb views of the city from an old fashioned, but large Ferris wheel.<br><br>We did not buy tickets in advance, as we weren’t sure what the queues would be and couldn’t face a long wait.  We arrived at about 17:00 on a Thursday in August and there was no queue for tickets and a 5 minute wait for the wheel.  <br><br>There were about 10 people in each compartment, although some were used for private dining  which looked lovely!
3;Fantastic experience and great views;Excellent ride, worth taking the trip to on the ferris wheel.  It is iconic of Vienna from its appearance in The Third Man.  The queue wasn't too long and the ride was great.  We didn't buy tickets in advance, just queued up.
3;Lovely old ferris wheel.;This was on my list of things to see and do when in Vienna, it is very easy to get to vi's the U1 metro line but however as it was a nice day we walked from St Stephens Cathedral which too us around 30mins. <br><br>Obviously the wheel itself has a lof ot history, is very old and beautiful, well maintained etc, inside the recording area is a display of the wheel and park through the years which is pretty interesting. <br><br>It cost 13.50€ per person and at around 3pm on a Friday there was no queue. <br><br>The only bad thing I'd say it that it's all over and done with very quickly!!<br><br>Worth seeing but not sure if it's worth the few minute ride.
3;Didn’t “Skip the line” at all!;I’ve booked these tickets for my wife and I. Our experience was a very disappointing one as we were not able to skip the line at all.<br><br>I tried to scan the code barcode on the ticket on the reader at the turnstile and it wouldn’t let me in. When I enquired at the ticket office they said I needed to join the queue so they could give me a different ticket with a QR code on it!
3;A Big Gem of Art;This museum took us by surprise, lots of Picassos, Monet and many other impressionists. Many other styles to whet your appetite if you’re an art lover. We particularly appreciated the description of each artists work and his changes in style. One of the best we have visited.
3;Totally worth visiting, even if you are not 100% art fan;The place is huge! 3 floors filled with numerous rooms and thousands of famous artists paintings.   Be patient when going in, the lines in wardrobe and ticket checkpoint are long..When already in, there is plenty of space to troll around.
3;Arts for the Whole Family - Must visit in Vienna !;We visited in December 2022 with two kids (5 and 9). The kids took a picture of their favourite painting in each room - now we have a whole collection of memories via those pictures! We parents enjoyed the works of art, the paintings, the cultural experience in the heart of Vienna. Very impressive and highly recommendable for a visit!
3;Lovely art;This was an excellent museum housing much Viennese and German art. We spent about 2 hours here.  There are also the state apartments were excellent<br>Sadly, no museum guide was available - they are missing something here. I would definitely have purchased one, had it been available.<br>The cafe is very good, if a little pricey. Not like your normal museum cafe - more up-market.<br>You also have the option to leave the museum, and return later in the day - just get a colour-coded sticker.
3;Excellent art gallery;Our unplanned visit here was not regretted - fantastic collection and we really enjoyed the current Alex Katz exhibition.  Definitely recommend.
3;Must visit;I found the different techniques of orinting very interesting and informative. Monet’s lily pond is at the museum but not the Japanese garden
3;Rude workers;Although the museum is totally worth it, the workers are the rudest people. There is one lady at the gift store with black hair, short and fat that was always making really rude faces and yelling at children. This attitude won’t get her anywhere.
3;Outstanding Impessionist Collection;Visited just for the Batliner Collection of Monet to Picasso. <br>It was fantastic, especially as we’re familiar with the works from our time in Provence. Well laid out and a stunning painting at every turn. <br>The State Rooms were beautiful too and we felt we then didn’t need to visit all the other lavish palaces in town. There's only so much gold we can contemplate ....
4;Relaxing  and . interesting;A nice varied choice of art to view. Nice comfortable relaxing gallery to wander round. We really enjoyed it.<br>Nice to mention that in all museums  and . galleries you hang up your coats in a cloakroom small fee of 1 euro or a tip depending on museum/gallery. Especially in the winter it makes it so much more comfortable to walk around.
4;Monet, Picasso, and modern art. Stunning collection;The museum has printed history, thoughts, and reflections about each period of art history, the artists, and individual paintings. Beautifully laid out and informative for art buffs and novices alike. <br>Enjoy the vibrant, colorful African art by Ruth Baumgarte, then walk through the state rooms with Renaissance artists like Michelangelo, Durer, Rubens, and Bruegel. Then enter the modern impressionist gallery of Monet, Cezanne, Renoir, up to cubist Picasso and so much more.
4;Worst visiting experience!;We both had a valid Vienna pass but we’re refused entrance because it was too busy. Very impolite staff to say the least!
4;Amazing how much history;Got off the Hop on, Hop off bus for Christmas Market and walked around. Amazing architecture everywhere and people very willing to help with directions.
4;Small but lovely gallery;Not particularly big (and it’s a good thing) with a lovely selection of art pieces! The museum building itself is not impressive in the inside, but it’s well made. All descriptions are both in German and English and the upper floor houses a good amount of fantastic paintings. The price is fairly steep though, and no student discount.
4;A worthwhile way to spend your time and money;Our visit to the Albertina was great.  We were able to see the ‘Monet to Picasso’ exhibition as well as the Basquiat exhibition.  The information provided along with each of the paintings was done so well, it expounded a little on the artist’s life at that stage, as well as the art itself, a well-rounded exhibition all over.  The Basquiat exhibition was augmented by a video as well as a long written piece at the entrance.  I can recommend this museum for a visit of at least 1-2 hours.  It’s worth the time and the money.
4;Great museum;It’s a big museum in the historical district full of shops, beautiful architecture, restaurants and museums.  <br><br>We went to see Jean Basquiat exhibition which will end in 8/1/23.  There are other great exhibitions there as well.  There is a nice cafe on the ground floor.  <br><br>Luckily we booked both Albertina and Albertina Modern on the internet and we didn’t have to queue.  Both of them are great museums.  Highly recommended for art lovers.
4;Not enough time;We only had a couple of hours, immediately aware this was totally insufficient time to complete the museum, galleries of modern Art and masterpieces. Exhibit of palaces in superb conditions
4;A Big Gem of Art;This museum took us by surprise, lots of Picassos, Monet and many other impressionists. Many other styles to whet your appetite if you’re an art lover. We particularly appreciated the description of each artists work and his changes in style. One of the best we have visited.
4;Totally worth visiting, even if you are not 100% art fan;The place is huge! 3 floors filled with numerous rooms and thousands of famous artists paintings.   Be patient when going in, the lines in wardrobe and ticket checkpoint are long..When already in, there is plenty of space to troll around.

5;Glittering reminder of times past;If the intention is to also visit the Schonbrunn Palace, it is worth buying a combo ticket on-line which as well as saving money also skips the queues and the requirement and hassle of having to buy a timed ticket for Schonbrunn.<br>Price includes good audio-guide that provides just enough detail without being too verbose. The tour which follows a set route takes around two hours in total and starts on the ground floor with a tableware collection which we found only mildly interesting although the craftsmanship is undisputed. The best bits are firstly the upstairs rooms that houses the Sisi museum profiling the complex Empress Elizabeth, (Emperor Franz Josef’s wife) which was very well curated together with the Imperial Apartments that follows on. <br>Everything in the museum was extremely well organised and efficient.
5;A delightful dive into Vienna’s imperial history;This is one of the most iconic attractions in Vienna for a reason. Just the grandeur and spectacle of the building and the grounds is enough to get you interested, but inside there is the brilliantly maintained living quarters of Franz Joseph and his family, along with an intriguing museum about Empress Elizabeth (also known as Sisi!). Alongside this is a great audio guide in many languages, and even a collection of their silver and crockery if that floats your boat! It is an absolute must-do if you visit Vienna, and it is very easily reached by tram or U-Bahn. However, especially during busy periods, you MUST book online (the tickets are not time slot or date fixed but they allow you to skip the often ridiculous ticket queues).
5;Impressive!;The Hofburg Palace is another example of the opulence of the Habsburg  dynasty. <br>It has been here for over 700 years as the seat of Austrian power. Up until the end of the monarchy in 1918, it had served as the official home of the Habsburg Empire and the imperial winter residence.<br><br>The house of Habsburg was one of the most important dynasties in Europe at the time as it produced some of the kings that ruled Western Europe for several decades starting from the 15th century. You will be able to admire the beauty and style of the baroque architecture, take a tour through the imperial apartments and visit the museums in the complex. Don’t miss the Imperial Treasury. It is the largest and most impressive treasury in the world. Today, the palace serves as the official home of Austria’s president.
5;The Hofburg - an absolute must;The Hofburg was brilliant.  Lots to see and take in and learn about the Emperor and of course his wife, Sisi.  The buildings are amazing and well looked after, deep in history.  We went around 2pm and stayed for about 2.5/3 hours.  Audio tours are well worth it.   In the heart of downtown Vienna with the Spanish Horses sharing the building.  Also highly recommend a visit there even if just to book into a training hour at 10am one morning.
5;Beautiful and interesting;This is a must-see when visiting Vienna. We enjoyed the palace apartments and the Sisi Museum. The silver collection was distinctly underwhelming and slightly boring…we felt we had to do it just to get to the good stuff (it’s at the start of the tour). Shame it couldn’t be missed out and not paid for as part of the package. <br><br>The palace is beautiful and the rooms are worth exploring slowly and carefully to see every detail. The Sisi museum is particularly good if you know nothing about her, as we came away well informed and interested by this historic figure! It was slightly crowded and very dark/narrow in places, so not a particularly great one for disabled individuals.
5;A must see attraction;The ticket is for 3 attractions the silver collection where you go through many rooms filled with China dishes, serving plates, center pieces and more. The Sisi museums which takes your for a full history about Sisi and finally the royal apartments which are very well maintained. We took the audio tour which was very nice there is also normal tours.
5;Silverware is amazing, Sisi Museum only so-so, Franz Josef rooms very good;We started with the silver (for which reads cutlery and plates) museum which was absolutely amazing and we spent an hour just there.  The Sisi museum which is the next part of the tour was a bit disappointing - parts of the exhibition are just weird (but then Sisi herself was apparently bonkers - lots of parallels with the Princess of Wales).  The Sisi experience is IMHO overhyped.   The tour finishes with the rest of the Imperial Palace which is interesting if a little predictable.   However, the whole thing at 16 Euros was very good value.
5;Sisi museum the best;The Sisi Museum in the Hofburg show an authentic look at the life of the famous Empress Elisabeth, known as Sisi. It show on Elisabeth private life, her rebellion against the court ceremonial, her flight into beauty, sporting excellence. Numerous personal objects of Elisabeth and clothing. Very interesting
5;The Sissi Palace !!!!;Another on our list of places to visit and one of the best attractions in Vienna and worth every penny spent.  We purchased our tickets on line via Trip Advisor but they can be  purchased on the day and there were not large queues when we visited in March.  First of all you go into the pottery section which is huge and there are some fine pieces there, even Napoleon's dinner service which is quite large or larger than  he was !!!! After this you are then led into the Royal Apartments which again are breath taking.  You can follow the story of Sissi and how trajic her life was and tells the story of a young girl who found fame to hard to adapt too.  Some of her costumes are outstanding and jewellery collection as well as many of her other private and personnel belongings.  Photographs are allowed in the pottery section but not in the private rooms at all.  Once again there are lockers for bags and coats and also a audio guide which is provided free of charge which gives a very precise documentary when visiting each room. Overall a very packed two hour tour and again  well worth every penny spent and a must see in Vienna.
5;Royalty introduction to life in the early 1900’s;We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to The Hofburg Imperial apartments. This gave some very nice insight to the lifestyle and history of the family, living conditions and the era. I would highly recommend this as a short start to a big series of museums to visit in this beautiful city.
5;very beautiful;This palace is one of the largest palace complexes in the world. No wonder, since it has been the residence of Austria's rulers for many, many centuries. It is also worth mentioning that it is the modern residence of the Austrian president.  The palace impresses with its size, uniqueness and how elaborate and varied it is. At its back, there is a beautiful park where you can sit and admire the beauty of the architecture and nature. <br> I might also add that it is worth visiting the palace at night, as the views are stunning.
5;Another impressive piece of architecture;We visited the Sisi Museum which really did go overboard with the display of the life of Kaiserin Elisabeth. The display of china, glass, cutlery and cooking pots was immense and would have been more interesting presented in a household setting than like a museum in brightly lit glass cabinets. The royal apartments were interesting but would have liked more emphasis on these than the many rooms devoted to the assassinated Kaiserin.
5;Another Must Do;This was the residence of the Emperor of Austria and the royal family. It is now government offices and holds the Cici Museum. While we were there the President was welcoming an ambassador to the country. It appeared that the car had a French Flag on it when it left. This place is on a large acreage and is in the middle of a lot of interesting architecture and museums. You can spend days in the area viewing things but this museum and palace are the crown jewels in the area.
5;Palace!;Visited palace in order to see Sisi museum, the Royal apartments and the Imperial treasury. Walking distance from the centre of Vienna thus we enjoy walking prior visiting. <br>Located close to the "Museums area" thus you can compare your visit with visiting also some other places as we have done.
6;Draconian closing procedures mar an otherwise otherworldly experience;Draconian and uniquely militaristic early closing procedures — the young and creepily awkward staff invade your personal space and create a human wall squeezing you down the stairs at 5:45 for a 6:00 closing time — left a very bad taste in our mouths after an otherwise wonderful experience with the artworks and setting.<br><br>The museum makes extra money by renting to private events for rich people in the evening, so apparently the management decided that it’s worth it to train employees to literally come within inches of your face (with bad breath too) telling you to they are closed and “you must walk now” even when they aren’t closed yet and you are just steps from the exit at 5:45 catching a last glimpse of the decorations.  <br><br>They then create a human chain wall behind you so you can’t possible walk backwards even if a member of your party is still steps away in the museum.  <br><br>They also send what look almost like teenagers to stare at you as you get your items from the locker — literally feet from your face and staring right at you — and as you enter and exit the bathroom, hovering by the bathroom door near the sinks.  <br><br>Someone in management may have learned about customer service training from an Austrian history book about running concentration camps, where they sent the Jews and other undesirables, as the style seemed eerily familiar, with tactics that are grossly deviant from the norm of dealing with a civilian population and highly dehumanizing and mechanistic.  I’ve never been more creeped out by a museum staff and I’ve been to hundreds of museums.  <br><br>Before posting this review I reached out to their customer service email contact to voice my complaint and allow them a chance to respond (very politely and with many compliments to the museum and in a much more reserved style than this review) and would have been content with a simple “I’m sorry you were uncomfortable and we will look into those procedures.”  Unfortunately no one could be bothered and I received absolutely no response.  <br><br>I also messaged the director Ms. Sabine Haag and the general manager Mr. Paul Frey.  Neither bothered to respond nor did their assistants.  This shows the issue of poor customer relations is, sadly, systemic.  <br><br>I’m very sorry to have to leave such a review for such an otherwise wonderful museum, but how we treat each other should be just as important as the content of our art collections.  <br><br>I’m fairness to the people who work so hard there keeping the place so fabulous, I would specifically like to compliment the comfort of the couches, the impeccable design and way of displaying the works in their settings, and the friendliness of the staff up until 5:30.  <br><br>The art collection that the Austrian monarchs usurped with their riches and power is truly spectacular and should be shared freely with the world as it is truly world heritage and world class.  The everyday working people of Europe from Serbia to Prague who sacrificed to give the Hapsburgs their gold and make Austria one of the wealthiest nations in the world and the millions who died stopping Austria and Germany from bringing unspeakable darkness to our civilization deserve respectful and open access to this collection of art that reflects the best of our shared humanity and sparks us to this differently and more creatively about how to respond to crises in the future.<br><br>Thank you for sharing and I hope to see this institution thrive and do better.  <br><br>
6;It was mindblowing!;Unbelievable. One of the most impressive museums I have ever seen. The marble Chambers where the artefacts are on display are absolutely beautiful. The lighting is perfect and the history just flows from room to room. Really reasonably priced when you purchase a kombi ticket with kunsthistorisches museum and the imperial treasury. Well worth a visit!
6;Incredible;We loved visiting here. The restaurant was in the most amazing setting, the food was good. The exhibitions were awe inspiring as was the architecture.
6;Loved it!;Spent 3 hours enjoying the art in such a beautiful building!  Cloakroom is free, for bags and coats. Lots of toilets on each floor. Lovely food place, great soup, but allow time to queue. Very helpful info people by entrance told what not to miss.
6;Time travel;You go because you would like to see some classic pieces, to be provoked and educated, to which this place delivers far beyond. Take your time and savour the museum building as it's as much as the artefacts. We had a teenager and she simply loved it.
6;Must see!;What an incredible museum! We loved the cafe too with tortes and hot chocolates. The paintings from the Habsburg collection are a wonder to behold- especially interesting were the paintings of the royal family. The Bruegel collection was magnificent.
6;One of the richest museum in the World;Very deep and wide range of pieces. We focused on 15th to 17th century. So many great artists: Brueghel, Kranach, Memling, Rubens, Rembrant, ..It is amazing and heavy. Too many great paintings!<br>You would need to spend days to enjoys fully
6;Interesting Art  and . Artefacts from all over the world !;This was an excellent experience and well worth the time and effort. Every room was filled with the most beautiful art or artefacts from around the world.  The displays were well presented and kept us interested in every room we entered. The wealth of it all was a little obscene but I think they are very much in the right place for everybody to admire. I was in awe of the craftsmanship of many of the pieces displayed especially as the were historical artefacts. See my photos and if you can, definitely visit here if visiting Vienna.
6;When visiting Vienna, this is a must!;The Kuntshistoriches is a must for those who appreciate Art.  This must be one of the best Art collections in the world.  It also has an amazing coffee shop.  I have never experienced anything like it.  WOW!!  This art museum alone will draw us back to Vienna.  Not much British art though, from every else practically.  This could take several hours and maybe a full day if you wish to see the Eygeptian rooms and middle eastern antiquities .
6;Well worth a visit;This was one of the highlights of our visit. A most impressive building and exceptional range of paintings. We enjoyed a coffee in the Cafe, which is a spectacular setting it its own right. I would strongly recommend a visit and I am not normally a great art gallery fan. The museum was not particularly busy and there was plenty of space and time to view all the exhibits. We used the audio guides which were very helpful
6;Insta friendly space und must see;I have not had the opportunity to be inside this place, but I can safely say that from the outside the place makes a very good impression. This "complex" consists of two buildings facing each other. In the space between, there is a beautiful fountain, benches where you can sit and admire the beauty of Vienna, and a lot of very well-kept greenery.<br>This place has only one disadvantage: a lot of rats running outside
7;Fascinating History, incredible place.;Our guide, Ilse, was punctual, accommodating, interesting and so passionate. She made the history and art come alive and really applicable to our personal histories and the impact of the times, people and events that shape us. I learned things I did not know and I studied art history. I cannot recommend Ilse or this tour enough. Deeply touching. Incredible place and history, wonderful guide.
7;Terrific;Suzanne was excellent - smart, engaged and perfect English! She helped us appreciate what we were seeing and also offered helpful suggestions for the rest of our trip in Vienna.
7;Great visit;Annelie is a great guide. She is very knowledgeable in Greek  and . Roman ethimologies, Art nouveau  and . modern art. <br>She made her visit very pleasant.
7;Fabulous small group tours!;We did two tours through Insight Cities -- the Belvedere small group tour with Katarina and the Jewish Vienna tour with Annelie.  Both tours were excellent, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend any tour that Insight offers.  Both of our guides were extremely knowledgeable, with advanced degrees in history or other relevant subjects.  Flawless English, personable, and able to go "off script" and answer questions on just about anything.  And the owner of the company was lovely to deal with when we had an issue about dates for our tour -- highly responsive and thoughtful.  We've done small group tours in most European cities, and these were some of the best we've ever had!
7;Perfect tour with guide Annelie in Belvédère palace;Gustav Klimt was for us the favorite part of the experience. Our guide could tell a lot about him .<br>We had a perfect tour with our guide Annelie. She gave us a lot of information about the history, the art and the gardens of this beautiful palace. She gave us the opportunity to ask questions. We really appreciated the private tiur with two persons.
7;Klimpt..the kiss;Our visit was short but we were able to see the gardens and fountains. Inside the palace which was built as a summer palace for prince Eugène of Savoy  they house a collection of Klimpt paintings 2hich include the kiss.In addition there are paintings by Scheile .
7;Attractive palace and gardens;We had free entrance to this venue with our Vienna Pass, but it’s not worth it to see inside, as it’s mostly just an art exhibition. <br>The outside of the building, the gardens and fountains are all that’s worth going to see, they are stunning, and free to visit.
7;Great tour and tour guide!!;We arrived in Vienna with only one full day to enjoy the sights.  A tour of the Belvedere was recommended and did not disappoint!!  We arrived a little early and had no problem getting in. Our tour guide Alan met us at the ticket office as scheduled.  We went through the Belvedere receiving highlights of the art and artists as well as the history of the Vienna. Other tourists recognized that Alan was doing such a great job that they listened in and even started to ask him questions. We all enjoyed listening. A note to seniors: be prepared for climbing steps. Not stopping with the Belvedere, Alan added on a walking tour and even guided us through the city on public transportation. Nothing bad about the tour other than the light rain during our walking tour that did not detract from the visit. Thanks Alan for making this one of our very best tours! We would have never had such a great day and visit to Vienna without this tour.  We will return!
7;Artfully stunning;I waited a long time in a couple of lineups to get into the art gallery but so worth it. Several rooms of assorted artists which was amazing. Klimt's works was worth the wait, he was such an inspiration to see.<br>Wear good shoes and plan on being there about three hours, well worth it!
7;Enchanting! Must see;Belvedere Palace Gardens is truly enchanting. Its worth the visit and do allow at least 2 to 3 hours, more if you can to grab a coffee @ the cafe. We finished off our visit with a raspberry chocolate cake and lemon tarte. Memorable visit and highly recommended.
8;What a view!;The whole city can be seen from this tower, such a breathtaking experience! The cafe staff was very lovely and efficient too :)<br>Absolutely worth visiting, during any time of the day.
8;Love the views;You have nice panoramic views from the top of the tower. We couldn't have time to enjoy the views from the restaurant, as it was closed in the morning.
8;Amazing views of Vienna;Enjoyed amazing views of Vienna from the Danube Tower (Donauturm) observation platform on a chilly day in late February 2023. After taking in amazing views, I decided to warm up with a cappuccino and apple strudel in the café. Great place to visit when in Vienna.
8;Interesting, spectacular;The service was very nice and kind.<br><br>Hint 1: you need to make a reservation if you want to go to the restaurant.<br><br>Hint 2: the tower where you sit for a coffee it turns around it is amazing!<br><br>Must to go if you want to visit Danube
8;Landmark;The Danube Tower is a wonderful landmark of the beautiful city of Vienna.<br>There are many such tower's throughout Europe ,this one is viewable from most districts of the city ,the views are amazing ,the cafe is cool ,nothing better than having a meal and beer up here in the tower and taking in the stunning views afforded from the tower ,on my recent visit to Vienna in December I never visited the tower but I have on many occasions over the years ,it's most definitely well worth checking out if you're planning a holiday to Vienna.
8;Come for the food, stay for the views.;Came here in October 2020, final day before flying back to Australia after a 6 week holiday. Decided to treat myself to a 4 course meal. Food was amazing and views were fantastic. Staff very friendly. Will come back again next time.
8;Breathtaking views of Vienna;We took the U1 from Vienna and had a lovely walk through the Danube Park to get to the tower.  (The park is very large and beautiful to see).  Once at the top of the tower, we were treated to magnificent 360 degree views of the city and a simple lunch in the cafe, which is a rotating restaurant.  Our waiter was a bit of a character, but in a good way.  The whole excursion took about 4 hours, including the underground ride and walk to and from the tower.  As we visited in the off season, there were very few people in the park and tower, making the entire experience very pleasant.
8;Day visit to top;Great view, signs above stating what you are looking towards. Went in Cafe and had a drink and slice of cake.Takes about 30mins for the rotation to be completed
8;Great photos;Great walk from the train station. Not long... panaramic view of Viena. Nice apple struddle with cream. Kids enjoyed it... Nice small break worth a visit.
8;Magnificent views, it's worth every cent!;Magnificent views, it's worth every cent! You can enjoy your melange while the tower slowly turns, showing beautiful scenery inch after inch.
8;Tower and view good;Fantastic views and surroundings. Easy to get to from metro station - 10 minute walk through a nice park. Staff at desk and lift very friendly. We had a great sunny day for it.<br>Unfortunately our experience in the restaurant marred our experience. The restaurant revolves slowly which is cool.However, whilst the food and drinks were refreshing be aware the minimum payment by card is €20. My husband does not like heights so just me and my son went up and it was easier for me to take my card rather than loose cash up which my husband stayed downstairs with. <br>Our bill came to just over €10 but the waiter was astonished and rude when realised we only had a card, We are not ignorant tourists and did come to Vienna with cash it was just that my husband was downstairs with the cash and whilst I perhaps could understand that maybe the restaurant has to pay a surcharge for card payments under €20 I saw no signs anywhere stating this or I may have thought to order more food. What incensed me was the rudeness of the waiter and the fact he then said loudly to other customers in Austrian ‘this woman has no cash!’ which completely ruined what had been a good visit up until then. He did begrudgingly accept the card then moaned about having to print off 3 receipts! We left quickly feeling rather embarrassed and belittled.
9;Learn more</span> about animal welfare in tourism;Interior nice otherwise not that good
9;Visited this museum as it was apparently a big attraction in Vienna, the museum was absolutely stunning interior on the walls and ceiling however the main museum had two floors but not worth €16 which they recently put the price up! Not really worth it.;OCD Dreamland
9;Whoever organised this place has crippling OCD and I am here for it! This building has literally every natural thing you may ever wish or need to see organised in excruciating detail. I loved every second and to top it off the building is beyond stunning! Highly recommended visit and not expensive!;Wonderful
9;The Vienna Natural History Museum, also known as the Naturhistorisches Museum Wien, is a must-visit attraction for anyone interested in natural history and science. The museum houses an extensive collection of over 30 million objects, including fossils, minerals, rocks, and specimens of plants and animals from around the world.<br><br>The building itself is impressive, with grand architecture and beautiful interiors. One of the highlights of the museum is the exhibit on the prehistoric world, which includes a life-sized model of a Diplodocus dinosaur. Another popular exhibit is the Venus Cabinet, which displays a stunning collection of minerals and gemstones.<br><br>Visitors can also enjoy the numerous interactive displays and multimedia exhibits, which make learning about science and natural history fun and engaging. The museum is well-organized, with clear signage and helpful staff, making it easy to navigate and get the most out of your visit.<br><br>Overall, the Vienna Natural History Museum is a fascinating and educational experience that is well worth a visit for anyone interested in science and natural history.;Thrilling Experience for the Whole Family - just Royal!
9;We visited in December 2022, with two boys (5 and 9). As you enter the building, you can't stop saying "wow" as this is a really jaw-dropping museum! Royal decoration inside, wide stairs, most beautiful grand lamps, you just can stop admiring! The collection itself is very impressive - kids were spending time watching tens of alligators, various animals, elephants, etc! the hall with Dinosaurs was also remarkable. It is just stunning! A very interesting and educative experience for Families!;Amazing collections
9;Amazing collections and I think is a must visit when visiting Vienna. The only issue for me was that many exhibits had no English translation for information. Around 3 - 3:30 hours for a fast visit, will cover both levels of the museum;An excellent experience
9;I visited for the second time. Is one of my favourite museums. Even though it is huge and we needed around 4 hours to see everything we really enjoyed it. The displays are really interesting and there’s a nice caffe. But I suggest the audio guide because the most of the displays have written information in German.;Disappointed
9;I visited the Smithsonian Natural History Museum in in Washington DC and e is ted the same amazing experience. I was very disappointed in the fact that many displays and models we’re not actually real …either artificial or duplicates or 3 D printed models . <br>The only good thing was that teens upto age 18 enter for free;Mirror image of Kunsthistrorisches Museum building
9;Located on and flanking Maria Theresien Platz are the Museum Of Fine Arts and The Natural History Museum ,two near identical buildings .<br>The Natural History Museum like Museum Of Fine Arts was commissioned by Emperor Franz Joseph I and designed by architects Gottfried Sempere and Carl Hasenauer and constructed in the beautiful Renaissance style of architecture that's so pleasing on the eye ,The Natural History Museum was founded in 1889 and is one of the most important natural history museums in the world ,never visited on this occasion but I have on previous holidays to this most beautiful of city's and it's truly fascinating and if you're planning on visiting put the best part of at least four hours plus to see most of the best exhibits ,it's amazing ,it's a must go destination and well worth checking out ,easy to locate on Maria Theresien Platz.;Visiting natural history museum
9;I highly recommend visit here, the price is reasonable, compared what you can see and experience here. Much information and a lot of activities. Cafeteria was unfortunately expensive and service was bad.;Information heaven!
10;about animal welfare in tourism;Not so happy animals
10;In the beginning the experience was impressive but after every floor we climbed higher the   animals just got bigger and more intelligent. Terrestrial animals stuffed in extremely small enclosures. In the end it was just animal cruelty.;Ok half day
10;The aquarium itself is big with 11 stories. It has many types of fish in each floor. But if you have been to other aquariums you will not be that impressed. If this is your first visit to an aquarium you will like it. Can easily spend half a day there. Book your tickets online to avoid long queues;Dont go
10;Not good. Not for couples this is absolutely awful family place. Ticket is expensive and the place is not worthy. It was not clean place and some fish/animals had way too small area. There were birds and they were free to fly without glass walls and it was good. I became a little sad here. <br><br>Here was too much kids and all of them were yelling so noisy! We had to put earplugs because our heads were going to explode. <br><br>If you thinks is this worthy  place to visit I recommend that dont go. <br>;Beautiful
10;Had a great time very big and beautiful aquarium the 360° view of the sharks was mesmerizing but I would have loved to see more shark spieces . Overall had a great time a bit expensive but I would say it's worth a visit.;Nice basic aquarium/zoo
10;We visited Haus Des Meeres on christmas, whoch was a nice activity for a child (2-years) and adults also. The system of so many levels is kind of tricky with little kinds with strolles cause everybody uses the lift even though they don’t have strollers. So half of our time was waiting for the elevator. We also thought that the zoo could be fitted in just few levels. The size of the building doesn’t maybe equil up to the amount what is inside. Still a nice experience!;Great experience for all ages
10;We had a great experience and we highly recommand it. Seeing animals and birds free around us brought this museum to the top of our preferences amongst all the aquariums that we’ve visited.;Huge place, at least 2 hours experience
10;One of the best Aqua Terra Zoo;
10;It was a lovely day, unfortunately it was raining a lot outside but I didn't mind because this zoo is indoors, it is an high tower with hundreds of species of fish,reptiles,amphibians,birds and mammals.Also some mammoth fish tanks,the sharks and the multi-level tropical house with monkeys. It has a restaurant at the roof terrace with incredible views of Vienna.;Impressive multi level aquarium
10;We spent some time out of the rain and cold during our august visit. The exhibits are impressive, lots of cool stuff to look at and learn about. Unique ant exhibit which was really unexpected. Also really awesome to see those Komodo dragons. Great views from the top along with a cafe / restaurant.  Was a bottleneck at the ticket counter. Anyone concerned with picking up an airborne respiratory virus should consider their options as people are packed in here like sardines - with seemingly very little ventilation- just an FYI - it didn’t adversely affect our trip other than it was really busy, stuffy and hot;Hours just go by in here
10;Very nice place to visit even with little kids (ours was 4 at that time). Interesting places, views of the city, interactive stuff, reasonable prices. At least 2-3 hours are necessary here. Could be better!
11;Museum top/ Leopold Cafè never again!!;Museum top!!<br>Cafè employees really rude and unpolite. The online ticket didn’t allow you to get in the Cafè because there is a machine for the paper ticket, I asked them help to get in and to get out, they replied “ I have nothing  to do with the entrance” I could get in because a visitor pass into the entrance machine his paper thicket. Very very bad service.
11;very beautiful;very beautiful museum, fantastic paintings, organized ... recommended. Schiele is my favorite painter
11;Klimt and Schiele yes,security no.;While the collection was very nice,the security check was a little much.<br>The Leopold Museum coffee should be poured in the Danube.<br>Great display of Schiele art.<br>Great display of Klimt art too.
11;Lots of Klimt  and . Schiele;This was not a large museum, but full of quality. Many paintings by Klimt and Schiele, amongst others, to stand and admire.
11;PhilTraveller : Rooftop terrace nice views;Rooftop terrace - free entry : <br><br>Great views across city through glass balcony.<br><br>Go round left of building to the external glass lift all the way to rooftop terrace for free(no need to buy museum ticket ).<br>(Don’t make mistake of taking the lift to the right of entrance as this only goes to cafe) <br><br>In March very quiet  and . small bar.., looks like could be a lively space in warmer weather.<br><br>The whole square is worth a wander  and . cafe in entrance to museum quarter good value  and . nice food.
11;Excellent 👍;I appreciated paintings and drawings it was one of the most important experience in my life. I preferred mostly because of Schiele expositions.
11;The best collection of Egon's Shiele's works.;I was pleased to have a free entry card on the International Women's Day on 8 March 2023. Of course, I will visit this museum again in the future with a paid ticket. I would like to see Egon's Shiele's paintings as well as other Austrian expressionists' work again and again. I am pleased that I saw some of ES's works that I had not seen before. I also like Klimt. Thank you very much.
11;TERRIBLE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE;TERRIBLE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE<br>The exhibition is amazing but sadly the aftertaste is bitter due to this idiotic / useless attitude: The Museum is open until 18:00. I went at 16:00 and timed my viewing so I can have ample time in the Shop. However arriving at the shop at 17:32 I was not admitted in, because supposedly it was closing at 17:30 and "it was the rules". Of course whoever was already in the shop could stay til 18:00 there (!?). I explained that I travelled from another country just for this, I needed just 5 minutes inside but they kept arguing with me about the rules (during which time I would have gone in, bought stuff and come out easily). <br><br>Even if this was the policy,  THEY SHOULD INFORM you when you get the ticket that the shop will close earlier, or at the very least announce it over the speakers (e.g. the Museum shop will close shortly). <br><br>TERRIBLE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE
11;Peaceful hours;I was enjoyed both of exhibition Wien 1900 and Tilla Durieux photos<br>There were not many people and so I could look at everything carefully
11;Klimt  and . Schiele Overload;The queue for the compulsory coat and bag check was snaking outside when we first tried to visit so came back later. Good job that tickets weren’t timed by the hour, just the day. <br>When we returned, we were enthralled from start to finish with Klimt and Schiele overload. <br>Loved the 1900 exhibition and the glassware was astonishing. <br>Superb museum really showcasing the best of Viennese art.
12;Fascinating History, incredible place.;Our guide, Ilse, was punctual, accommodating, interesting and so passionate. She made the history and art come alive and really applicable to our personal histories and the impact of the times, people and events that shape us. I learned things I did not know and I studied art history. I cannot recommend Ilse or this tour enough. Deeply touching. Incredible place and history, wonderful guide.
12;Terrific;Suzanne was excellent - smart, engaged and perfect English! She helped us appreciate what we were seeing and also offered helpful suggestions for the rest of our trip in Vienna.
12;Great visit;Annelie is a great guide. She is very knowledgeable in Greek  and . Roman ethimologies, Art nouveau  and . modern art. <br>She made her visit very pleasant.
12;Fabulous small group tours!;We did two tours through Insight Cities -- the Belvedere small group tour with Katarina and the Jewish Vienna tour with Annelie.  Both tours were excellent, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend any tour that Insight offers.  Both of our guides were extremely knowledgeable, with advanced degrees in history or other relevant subjects.  Flawless English, personable, and able to go "off script" and answer questions on just about anything.  And the owner of the company was lovely to deal with when we had an issue about dates for our tour -- highly responsive and thoughtful.  We've done small group tours in most European cities, and these were some of the best we've ever had!

12;Interesting, entertaining - great tour!;We really had a great tour with Annelie at the Belvedere. Plenty of interesting facts, anecdotes, historical tidbits and precious insights into art and history of this beautiful palace.
12;Very thorough art and site tour;Accommodating, knowledgeable, and patient guide<br>Will be worth your while and help you get more out of the visit
12;Klimpt..the kiss;Our visit was short but we were able to see the gardens and fountains. Inside the palace which was built as a summer palace for prince Eugène of Savoy  they house a collection of Klimpt paintings 2hich include the kiss.In addition there are paintings by Scheile .
13;For the young and every other age;I didn't expect to enjoy visiting here. As the only option on the bundemessen card available to me i went more so i didn't feel like i wasted my money, i was there for 3 HOURS.<br>An absolute must do, especially if you have kids. old trains, planes and automobiles are everywhere and a number of the interactive displays are really a lot of fun and educational. i noticed most of the guests stayed on the first floor DONT the top floor with its display on communication, travel and medicine through history is a must see.
13;Delightful visit for anyone interested in tech;3 main floors of all things technical, trains, planes, cars, power supply, home appliances etc. Descriptions and information in English on most displays. A sort of smaller scale London Science Museum. Well worth a look with good connections, tram 52 stops outside, and connects to the city U bahn. The surprise was the café, with waiter service and very good food at reasonable prices. Try coffee and cake or the sacker sausage and an Austrian beer.
13;Not like any museum I've been to;This is an amazing museum. 4 floors that cover so many things from food science, interactive science exhibits, transportation, Musical instruments and probably many more things I've forgotten. <br><br>Would be great for kids and adults alike
13;Maze;I loved the museum but I had huge problem with the way everything was displayed. It is like a maze. There are too many displays and rooms and we got lost a lot of times. It took us 3 hours and we didn’t even finish it. I recommend having a map in the museum.
13;Great Museum - Fun for Kids and Adults!;This was a great museum!  There is so much to see, you need all day or a couple of days to see it all.  The exhibits had many opportunities for people to touch and try.  You will not be disappointed - kids or adults alike!<br><br>Children under 19 are free and students get a discount!
13;The best museum EVER;We spent four hours here and it was not enough. This has got to be the best museum to interest everyone of all ages. From the very young (we saw children as young as 3 interacting with the displays), to the more senior (a group of 70+, were loving the history behind the steam engines and carriages). You can learn so much about the history of Austria without even realising it. I'm not one for reading endless plaques of words, but to interact with the displays was wonderful. I would suggest at least six hours here. It is well worth the money.
13;Good technical museum covering a lot of areas;An interesting museum for kids and adults that like technology, even trains are there. I visited in August 2020, so restrictions were in place. Masks are mandatory, and you need to keep distance from others, but that didn't stop me enjoying it. The building itself is interesting, especially the domed roof supports. There is a new big train being installed now, which should be a nice new attraction. Trains, including the oldest preserved Austrian locomotive, planes, engines, and an exhibit on film special effects. It is quite outside the main area, so a bus helps for getting there, unless you want to walk from West Station, about 20 minutes.
13;Great exhibits!;The museum is a little bit out of the way, but still quite easy to reach by tram. Do not miss the train and the steel production exhibits. If you are interested in technology at all you will have a great time and spend hours in the museum!
13;Who stops the rain ? Special effects ?;Bad Weather ? Bored? in for an adventure ? Go to Technical Museum in Vienna. So many displays and so well arranged. At the moment there is WOOW ... special effects.Fancy filming your own rear projection? Or suspending the forces of gravity? Or suddenly turning into a dwarf or experiencing the impact of various film soundtracks? You can do this and much more.Or Eliticity. What actually is electricity? And where does it come from? You can  explore it all, with lots of experiments and exciting exhibits! Afterwards to the Café „Joules Bistro“for a quick snack. You would actually need a whole week to explore everything, but one afternoon is well spent and the rain has stopped in the meantime.
13;Like a kid in a sweet shop;As someone mad on engineering I was like a kid in a sweetshop with this museum! Around every corner was another exciting exhibit. We need more museums like this with real things to see. The café served good food as well. The only downside was I couldn't see it all.
13;Best ever;First museum Ive spend so much time in. Strongly recommeneded to prepare for 3-4 hours or more. You just dont want to leave this place. A lot of interactive material, fascinating mashines. You would want to touch and see closely everything. And this taking into account, we didnt have a guide. I believe with a guide itsgenuine.
14;A treasure;Very good museum highlighting the robes, jewels, crowns and various treasures from successive dynasties. Interesting. Well laid out. Easy to follow in both German and English. <br>I have a year ticket to this and some other museums and galleries. I’ll be coming back I’m sure.
14;Unique bit of History;This is not the imperial treasury as a previous review noted. This is a small treasury of items owned by the Grand Masters of the Teutonic Knights. Only open a few times a week it has some incredible stuff, including some Papal Bulls from the medieval period, some fantastic table wear and the various vestments owned by the order.<br><br>Its small, it won't take you more than an hour and the explanations could be better, but it's a fascinating bit of history. <br><br>As a side note, you can apparently stay in the adjacent "hotel" owned by the Teutonic order and it's apparently one of the cheapest places to stay in central Vienna, just around the corner from the Stephensdom. It's a bit hidden and you have go up some stairs to find it and the curator was a few minutes late getting there.<br><br>Takes cash only, no credit cards for the small admission fee.
14;Wonderful historical exhibits;The visit to this museum was a thoroughly  enjoyable and interesting experience. The Imperial Crown dating from around AD 960 and the C17 Imperial Crown of Rudolph II are " must sees" together with the amazing embroidered Coronation mantle of Roger II , 1133. Other exhibits include a collection of heralds' tabards. All these are examples of the Habsburg family's wealth and power.
14;Imperial treasury-nice spot to see;We visited the royal treasury to see the amazing historic Crown Jewels as a part of a 3-day visit to Vienna to take in the sights during the festive holiday season.  As we were there early, shortly after they opened, it wasn't too busy so we could take our time moving through the galleries gawking at several imposing crowns loaded with walnut-sized emeralds, diamonds and sapphires and other symbols of royalty.<br><br>We didn't purchase the optional audio guide (in retrospect might have been nice, but certainly not essential) so spent time reading (in English) tags and signs that provided some of the history of the collection much of which dated back 500 years or more.<br><br>We spent about an hour perusing the collect-definitely worth a short visit I. Your schedule.
14;Tickets from $50.21;Tickets from $17.74
15;Mixed - tour only;
15;We did the afternoon tour of the building and stables which, at €19 per person was, in my view, very overpriced. You get to see the riding area, which is impressive and then visit the horses in the stables. For this part it would have got 1 star.<br><br>Fortunately, Florina, our tour guide, did a very good job of making a pretty ordinary tour reasonably interesting.<br><br>Therefore, my three stars are an average of 1 and 5.<br><br>I would not do the tour again but imagine seeing the horses in action would be very impressive so recommend you make sure you go for this.;Training
15;So after reading all the terrible reviews; we still decided to go to the training since it was the only available event left (not a full show).  <br>Yes, they trotted around and didn’t do their famous jumps, but for my 7 year old it was interesting to hear about what they did and see the different horses.  It is in German most of the time, which we understand, but they do translate an abbreviated version afterwards as well.  We had a seat on the one end but we did see the folks standing- that would be hard for an hour.. especially w kids. <br>Glad we went but of course we would have rather seen the actual performance.. next time. Disappointing visit
15;The training session is just 5 horses walking round the perimeter of the hall. It was nice to see inside but if you hope to see anything other than walking you will be disappointed. Several people left after 45mins as it was clear that nothing was going to happen. It's worth waiting outside under the arches to see the horses pass back to their stables for free.;Unique display
15;A unique demonstration on the 26th of three elements from ground when with the horses to seated demonstrations of the horse a riders' skills. Quite unique. We reserved our tickets, which were standing tickets, online. The only negative was the process by which we were guided to the actual viewing hall. The tickets were via 'Get Your Guide' and the instructions were very unclear once you were at the site. The ticket office is around 100m from the actual entrance (go outside and keep right until there large square) to the performance hall. Our digital tickets were not valid until we had exchanged them for paper tickets, which seems very inefficient and this was not clear in any way shape or form. The staff at the chaotic ticket office were not very helpful. This disorganisation aside, the performance was amazing.;One of the best !!!!
15;In all the attractions we visited, this has to be one of the best.  We decided long ago when we wanted to come to Vienna that the Spanish Riding school had to be on our bucket list and so pleased it was.  We took the guided tour which was worth every penny.  Only lasts one hour but our guide made sure we did not miss anything at all.  You are greeted in the main foyer by your tour guide and there are two language tours (German  and . English) so make sure you chose the right one.  You are taken around the whole arena, the tack rooms, the stables and the main court yard.  Photography is allowed but not in the stables and be prepared to be removed from the tour if you defy the guide and try and get a sneaky picture in the stables.  You are taken right up close to the magnificent horses but not within touching distance and you cannot imagine how graceful they are until you are standing beside them.  As I said earlier and having seen most of the attractions, this has to be one of the best.  They have practice sessions in the arena also where the general public can go and watch but a piece of advice, if you are going, then go early as it can get very busy. They have a lovely gift shop for your souveniers and a lovely café on site as well.;The most boring hour of my life
15;A friend of my recommended the 10AM training session before my trip, so I bought the ticket for it after arriving at the hotel.   What a mistake of wasted time and money!  There is nothing good to watch about these training sessions.  The riders bring out the horses individually. No choreography of any kind.  They ride and train the horses individually..  it’s really boring to watch.  I almost fell asleep at 10am in the morning.  There was one little kids made the comment at the end of the session… “ this is the most boring hour of my life”. Don’t waste money and time.;Go to the performance, not for training sessions!
15;Worth it, but check where your seats will be when you book!;
15;Stunning horses, a childhood dream fulfilled for me. We attended the Performance on 19th March 2023. Paid to get 2nd category seats which were in the upper Gallery (at one of the short ends of the school). Even then one has to shift position to see the manoeuvres as fully as possible. I think in the cheaper seats (along the long sides) you would still have a reasonably good view, especially in the first row. Best tip: there is a seating plan when you book tickets online so you can check the general area  in each ticket price category. <br><br>The young stallions who open the performance were fun, very lively and skittish. They are still getting used to the arena. The highlight was the Quadrille. The mature horses really did a beautiful job. I would recommend this experience for anyone with a love of these gorgeous creatures.;Vienna Highlight
15;We arrived well before the start of the Saturday morning show, and although the ticket office, shop and café are easy to find, it's not so clear where the entrance to the show is. (FYI, in the Josephsplatz, with the statue of Kaiser Joseph to your left). The door is unmarked. I had opted for the less expensive seats in the upper gallery, and although you can see everything clearly enough in the arena, you do spend a lot of time bending forward over the balustrade. For the sake of comfort and the best view, I would suggest spending more on the best seats, you won't regret it! A very polished show, a must for horse and riding lovers everywhere. By the way, no photography allowed in any form while the show is under way, they will come round to check that everyone is following the rules.;Beautiful horses -- premium seats totally not necessary
15;Beautiful horses and lovely venue at the Hofburg. The VORFÜHRUNG weekend show I saw included only four horses, not the 16 shown on the brochure. I should have bought one of the cheaper tickets on the side where the horses could be seen going through their paces just as well as where I sat in the center elevated seat at the front (where I paid for the highest price ticket). When the show ended everyone just sat there waiting for the big production that never came. Finally we realized it was over and everyone quietly filed out.;An interesting way to spend a Sunday morning
15;We booked tickets to the Classic show on a Sunday at 11am. <br><br>We arrived to collect our tickets (note : if you buy a voucher online you have to exchange for proper ticket at box office 45 mins prior to show) then headed around to wait for the doors to open. <br><br>Queue already started around 9:45 (doors open at 10:30) as standing is unreserved. <br><br>There is tiered standing around both sides of the viewing area but this fills up immediately - other standing is behind the seated guests in the aisles. <br><br>An excellent show with good descriptions / explanations from a member of staff. The horses were beautiful and the riders very skilled. <br><br>The show lasts around one hour. <br><br>No photography or videography during the show, but you are allowed to take pictures before and after.;What better than a day with horses?
16;Would not recommend this to my friends.;Beautiful building, average expositions. Modern art is difficult to judge. What is good, what is bad, what is ugly. So we judge it another way: would we recommend this museum to our friends that are known for their open mind for modern art. No, is the answer. The expositions are not intriguing except one of two parts.
16;There are better ways to spend your time and money;I am usually very excited to visit modern art museums, this time I was very disappointed.  My son joined me, and while he really enjoyed the Banksy exhibition in Prague, he kept on asking ‘what is the point of this?’.  Sadly I have to agree. <br><br>The exception to this was the Roma exhibit, which was small but hauntingly beautiful.  The combination of the music and the plants was absolutely mesmerizing. <br><br>A previous reviewer stated ‘pretentious and lacking substance’.  This ia probably the best description I’ve come across.
16;Interesting;If you're a lover of modern art, then you should visit this Museum. If not, then it's not something that you shouldn't miss. I wanted to experience more installations, but the basic expositions were mostly paintings. Maybe it was a matter of the time I visited the museum.
16;Biggest regret of my trip;I don’t know much about modern art, but I’m open minded and like to do different things. However, this was a complete waste of time and money. Several floors of the museum were empty and out of use, those that weren’t were full of pretentious garbage that means nothing to most people. What a rip off. Stick to the Albertina and Belvedere.
16;Cool Visual Art;I am usually the least likely to like Modern Art. however, there were several exhibits especially those of the visual arts with moment that I enjoyed.  In addition the Museum Quarter is an history architecture and structure and this building sticks out but I really loved the black stone edifice.  The art inside was different than most modern art studios and I really enjoyed my visit here.  It was my favorite part of the Museums quarter.
16;Don’t bother even if you love modern art;I usually like visiting contemporary art museums so had high hopes for this one considering it’s Vienna. What a disappointment. Dull works, little or no explanation of artists’ philosophy/concept (which is essential to understand modern art), no installations, only one video artwork. This summer we’ve been to the Louisiana museum of modern art in Denmark and expected something similar, what a disappointment! It took us no more than 30 min to check out all 7 floors. Go to the Leopold Museum next door instead, this was a real treat!
16;Rudest staff ever !!!!;Terrible staff. Very rude and arrogant "students" of art. They told us that we do not respect the paintings because we were in 0,5 meter distance.<br>Additionally, site was advertising Andy Warhol and there was nowhere in the museum.<br>Some paintings were terrible and THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME!!<br><br>
16;A bunker style building with meaningless exibitions;The exibtions where tottaly dispointing with an introductory text that generally did not fit with the objects exposed. The visitors seemed "lost on the (lack) of translation". There was some videos with some political/cultural interest lost in the midlle of exhibitions. I think that before going is necessary to check carefully what is happening there.
16;Really good - so long as you appreciate modern art - and Picasso!;The museum was quite an experience. It was very modern, as you would expect. There were a lot of floors but the lift was fast and efficient. Not sure I would recommend it unless you are a really big fan of modern art. My photos paint their own photo.<br>Note: the Picasso is worth seeing, of course!
16;If I could choose zero stars then I would;What a shocking waste of an incredible space and interesting building. We have just visited Mumok museum and found it to be an UTTER waste of money and time that I will never get back. I am an artist, and I appreciate art from all areas and ages, yet this is a display reminiscent of a low level GCSE art class. Poor quality exhibits, without any talent whatsoever.<br>But what really ruins that whole experience is the overzealous student 'guards' who follow you around and shout across the room when you walk within a metre of these tatty non descriptive 'treasures' in an attempt to publicly shame you for having the audacity to look at an exhibit. No one is actually touching these things (most are framed with glass anyway) and quite frankly if anyone did, then a little damage could actually add some interest. These pretentious students are clearly wanting to show some authority here, but the boy who was young enough to be my grandson, who shouted at me across the room because I leaned towards a print , was the last straw! We walked out.....I wish that I had read previous reviews before wasting my money!! It's the worst museum that I have ever visited and not one exhibit was worthy of being there...
16;Painting 2.0 is great, the rest sucks badly - don't waste your money if unsure;Well, where shall I start? Upper floors are great! Painting 2.0: the exhibition is huge and awesome, with great masterpieces. <br>The problem lies with the rest of the museum: underground floors disappointed me badly. We didn't saw the exposed Manet because: the curator thought it was a good idea to place it at a height of 3 or 4 meters, and because of the neon lights reflecting on the paint and totally covering it. They decided to organize the exhibition like if it were a storehouse... the point is that we use exhibition instead of storehouses because one can't actually see anything in a storehouse. Works from Kandinsky and other great artists hidden at 2 or 3 meters of height just because... no one knows, there's no reason at all. The most ridiculous thing is that with more than 100 paintings the curator (that at this point I can absolutely call an incompetent)decided to focus on the guy that collected them, without providing any information  about works and paintings and artists. It was boring and disappointing: I could not believe such a disaster.<br><br>Concluding with a quantitative measurement, I spent 5 hours in the Leopold museum, 4 hours in the paint 2.0 exhibition and 5 minutes inside the rest of the mumok. It isn't worth it.
17;Impressive;A great Cathedral in the centre of Vienna along the pedestrian streets, very nice inside and free to get through the door unlike some places. Very impressive but being in the pedestrian zone it didn't stand out as much as some of the other impressive european cathedrals.
17;The centerpiece of Vienna;Having visited Rome, Florence, Krakow, Munich, and Prague, we’ve been fortunate enough to see some of the most beautiful churches in Europe.  St.Stephen’s stands among them. Grand doesn’t do it justice but it is the first work to come to mind.
17;worth the walk;Our walking tour finished adjacent to the cathedral. A beautiful church  with a very interesting roof. definitely worth a visit
17;Beautiful;Beautiful restored old cathedral. Destroyed at the end of WW2 by the departing Nazi army and now beautifully restored. The whole area around the cathedral is interesting and contains so much history
17;Love the Roof!;I particularly liked the roof of the church, with the color tiles displayed in unique designs! The inside is like many other cathedrals, but the walk up the stairs is worth it to see the roof up close. There was a soccer match the same day we visited, so the square was very busy with supporters  and . police, but we never felt unsafe. The entrance to the tower is somewhat obscure, as it's around the back side a bit.
17;St Stephen`s Cathedral Memorable in Vienna;This Stately St Stephen`s Cathedral dates from Rudolf 1V in the 14thC and is well worth visting  and highly recommended as the highest renaissance monument with its 446 ft spire that looks across the City .We were there during Mass for our prayers,solace and a sense of reflection on our family well-being visit that included the main baroque neo-classical sightseeing tour led by my son Lukas.There are weekly baroque classical concerts performed including Mozart and composers like William Byrd.The Cathedral was  prominent in defence in the Seige of Vienna 1529 and Battle of Vienna in 1689.Mozart`s  Funeral took place here in 1791 in the Holy Cross Chapel.
17;A Character Full Cathedral.;Saint Stephen's Cathedral is impressive inside and out. Outside it dominates the Stephanplatz Square where it stands in elegant splendour. Inside it is also a treat for the senses. Rich in history, it is well worth getting the audio tour and soaking in that history. This is the site where Mozart got married. That in itself was quite a story, with his on and off relationship with Constanze culminating in their marriage here on 4 August 1782, despite their separation the previous April when she had allowed another man to measure her calf during a parlour game. Shocking I know! All was well in the end however, even if his father's letter approving the union only arrived the day after the event had taken place. And it all happened here. The cathedral is full of such wonderful stories. Including the infamous man who made paintings ot the building from the square and sold them to tourists in the early years of the twentieth century. I'll leave it to you to find out who that unsavory character was.<br>Another more endearing character was the mason who carved a likeness of himself peeping out from under a pulpit!   Works for the church were meant to be conducted anonymously but this poor man wanted is bit of fame and he is still getting it today!
17;Stephensdome;The main altar was difficult to see as it was covered up for Lent.  To get near it ,one must cross right through to the other side of the entrance where one simply walks through the railing. It was dark and it had the feeling of being unused.  Sadly a museum rather than a warm place of worship.
17;Beautiful church in a bustling part of the city.;Beautiful cathedral, lost do do and see in the area.  There was some construction / maintenance blocking views, but that is to be expected in Europe - necessary to keep things preserved.
17;The South Tower is a killer, but totally worth it!;I recommend getting a ticket with all the extras.  The tower,  undercroft, etc., all add to the experience.  The audioguide definitely  helps provide depth to one's understanding of the building and the historical eras during which it stood.  Just remember that the hike up to the top of the South Tower is a feat of endurance—take your time!
17;A lovely impressive visit;Well worth a visit as it is really beautiful inside and it is free entry. If you wish to go up the North Tower there is a fee for the elevator (cash only when we visited 6 Euros) but it is worth it for the views. You can pay more and see all other areas of the Cathedral if you wish.
17;Would recommend;We really enjoyed walking around, we got the all inclusive ticket and got to see a lot. If you like history then this will be for you. We enjoyed the catacombs tour and going up to see the view of the city.
17;Highly Recommend. Very Impressive.;Beautiful cathedral inside and out. Visiting this was one of my favourite experiences.<br><br>I paid for the full cathedral package which includes the catacombs tour, cathedral tour (audio guide tour on the main floor), North tower ticket, and South tower ticket. Cathedral access is free, but you have to either pay for these experiences individually, or as package deals. (Note! They ONLY ACCEPT CASH!) <br><br>These are my thoughts on each aspect:<br><br>Catacombs - The group was quite large 30+ people, but the guide did a nice job providing commentary about the catacombs in German and English with some humour. This was a simple and interesting tour. I would recommend this.<br><br>Cathedral Tour - I think I could have personally gone without this tour, but it was still nice to learn about the cathedral's history. Recommend to those who want to learn more about the history. <br><br>North Tower - This was my favourite part of the visit! You take an elevator to the top of the North Tower where there is a small outdoors viewing area that you can get an amazing view of the city from. I recommend doing this on a nice day so you can get a view of the Alps. Highly recommend! <br><br>South Tower - You climb 300+ stairs to get to an enclosed viewing area at the top. The very narrow, spiral staircase has barely enough room to pass people on, so be prepared to carefully pass people going up or down, and pause when people ahead are taking breaks. This was cool to do, but I still like the North Tower more. Still recommend.
17;Beautiful!;Organized, kind and patient service! We took All inclusive tour. They had croatian audio guide!!!! Loved it! God bless you!
18;Fantastic Place;A real spectacle, well worth a visit. The craftsmanship is wonderful. <br>The resting place of Sisi too.<br>I would recommend a look especially if you have been to see the Sisi museum.
18;A hidden gem;This was great.<br><br>It showed how the rich and famous of the Times died and were kept. The coffins are so ornate and over the top, but equally great to see and read.<br><br>This is free attraction with the vienna pass
18;How the other half die.;Under the very beautiful Capuchin Church is this crypt where many of the great and perhaps good of the Habsburgs have been laid to rest. Hello magazine and others can show you how the rich and famous live. Well here is where you can find out how the die. Generally speaking this seems to be in huge ornate coffins that many help to design themselves before being interred therein.<br>The whole results in a slightly creepy but very interesting sort of small necropolis. I am definitely glad we went to see it but I wouldn't want to be locked in there after dark.
18;Fascinating and perhaps a bit creepy!;This is a must-see in Vienna if you are interested in history and the Habsburgs,  Extraordinary elaborate tombs and sarcophagi  of Emperors, Empresses, Archdukes, Princes.  Very special and perhaps a bit creepy which adds to the fun and mystery of an ancient European Imperial house which is no longer on the their throne.  Fascinating.
18;A bunch of overly ornate tombs;The massive burial chambers resemble neo-gothic versions of Mardi Gras floats. They are over the top. There is an extra charge to view these.
18;Not well-known, but worth it.;Not often found among Vienna's leading attractions, but we found it fascinating. You can trace the growth of the the Habsburg's power and wealth through the increasing lavishness of the sarcophagi, whitch reaches its peak with the stunning tomb of Maria Teresa. It's also easy to fit into a sightseeing schedule. if you don't feel compelled to pore over every detail, around an hour should suffice
18;Worth a quick visit;Interesting for a short visit, although the handout leaves much to be desired.  You're not really sure what you're looking at.
18;Worth a visit if your are into such things;This Imperial Crypt is the burial place for the Habsburgs, but urns with the internal organs are in the crypt of St Stephan's cathedral.
18;Fascinating Attraction;As a big fan of macabre attractions, this was right up my alley. There are several rooms of coffins, some decorated rather plainly, and some more lavish that I could ever imagine! The details on some of the coffins are incredible, and I enjoyed how close you were able to get to admire them. I would highly recommend a stop here while in Vienna.
18;A Rare Find;I stumbled across this online, many articles into things to do in Vienna.<br>Unsure why this is not as popular, it was an amazing experience that I am glad to have stumbled upon
18;Beyond expectation, jaw-dropping;The most striking thing is that I knew so little about this! Why isn't it talked about more? I found out about it by pure accident. Been to Vienna numerous times, and never knew about this place, although it's only a short walk (5 mins) away from the chatedral of St. Stephen's. <br>The centerpiece is defitely the dual sarcophagus of Maria Theresia and her husband. Jaw-dropping to look at. This is one of the most important women in history of Europe, period, and this crypt shows it.<br>Also, my late grandparents were born under Franz Joseph's rule, in 1906 and 1907 in Croatia (Austria-Hungary then), so it was astonishing to see his sarcophagus, too. I strongly recommend visiting this place and thank you to the Capuchins for taking care of it.
18;Short trip through the Habsburgs;When in Vienna, time to check out this small, compact imperial crypt with all the Habsburgs.<br>It's a bit expensive for the entrance. You see lots of elegant coffins, some much bigger than others and a family tree.<br>It's fairly small, took me about 30 minutes to complete it. The most popular one was Maximillian I of Mexico where you can see lots of Mexican gifts and honors.
18;Interesting;Interesting experience to visit the crypt after having seen the church. The remains of the Habsburgs through time have been laid to rest here in various types of sarcophagi from the very simple and sombre to the opulent and extravagant. The different rooms in the crypt each have their signature architecture, which ads to the experience. A little leaflet gives you a hint of who the tenants are, but if you are a bit nerdy, do some googling in advance. That gave me a better chance to navigate in names and lines. The tomb of Sisi is decorated with flowers, postcards, small tokens of affection etc. People are still attached to her and some treat her as a saint. Another member of the family, Emperor Karl I, was indeed beatified by the pope in 2004.
18;The crypt of the Habsburg Dynasty.;Beneath the Capuchin church lies the tombs of the Habsburg dynasty. Maria Theresa, Maximilian the doomed emperor of Mexico, Franz Josef and Sisi, and a host of others lie buried here. Their coffins are elaborate and sometimes in strange macabre taste, but for anyone with an interest in the history of Vienna, or the Habsburgs in general, this place is a must-see.
19;One of the best museums we’ve been to;We were so impressed by Haus der Musik. It’s really well laid out with lots of interesting stuff there, and having so many interactive exhibits was brilliant. We came on a midweek morning and it wasn’t too busy through most of the rooms. The one place we expected to be packed (the conducting experience on the top floor) was actually empty so we managed to spend loads of time there and between us conducted all of the different song options - so much fun! Would 100% recommend as a must see in the city.
19;The VR component was a bit odd, but overall great experience;Really cool exhibitions. About the science of sound, lives of composers, etc. There was an exhibition with VR about “producing your own sound”, but I dont really see the point of it. Children were excited at first with the VR, but they cant seem to see the point of it. They became bored and left this exhibit quickly. The part with composers contained too much information for us to take in. It would have been better if they categorize it into sections so it is easier to follow (Good examples would be Mozarthaus and Beethoven Museum). Top floor has an exhibit which lets you be a conductor, which is very cool, I like it very much. Very fun if you have friends to play about. The VR Beethoven game is only in German. I know a bit German just enough to know what is going on. Apparently you are helping Beethoven win a rap battle against some random young man. I dont see why beethoven needs to be involved in such event as his life or his works are not involved in the game at all, and such a game does not need a VR to be played since you are just clicking options of disses Beethoven should use in his next round. I got bored and left very soon. In the ground floor there was a public piano, you could play for free if you want. I gathered up my courage and played some pieces that I barely remembered from my younger days. I was surprised that some people watched and liked it. You could try if you know how to play the piano. It would be a bucket-list kind of experience: “performing music in Vienna”. Good luck haha ;)
19;great experience;it was really great, specially for our kids and also for us.. great experience, highly recommend it if you are in vienna
19;Orchestral History;The Haus der Musik focuses mainly on the city Orchestra and its various composers. There are many interesting facts displayed alongside historic items as well as many interactive activities for the kids.
19;Much more then a museum! 🎶🎹🎷;A great place for kids and adults who like music. Its a very interactive museum. My two and a half years old son really enjoyed the different activities . We spent around two hours touring the place.<br>Highly recommended.
19;Sound and house of Musik;Fantastic experience if you wish to learn more about the great composers of Vienna . Beethoven, Motzart, Strauss… and better under how sound works, the oscillations and frequency of what we can hear as humans and then you get to conduct your own concert!  Fun for all age groups and a must as very unique experience
19;Entertainment and activities!;A pleasant surprise. We visited Museum of music the only rainy afternoon we had in Vienna and we really had a nice/funny afternoon as in specific museum you can see, learn about music but also have activities. <br>Our 13 years old son had a fantastic time, same from our side.<br>Recommend specific museum for all visitors of Vienna.
19;Excellent;The Haus der Musik is well worth a visit. It is not a big museum but should definitely be on your itinerary if you visit Vienna. Vienna has a rich music history which is well exhibited in this museum. The museum also has interactive exhibits about the physics of sound and perception. The highlight for me was the virtual orchestra where you can have a virtual go at conducting the Vienna Philharmonic.
19;Take a Waltz down musical memory lane;This museum is easy to find and reasonably priced. <br>It has 4 floors with different exhibits such as the life of famous composers, hearing  and . sound interactive stands and a virtual conductor idea where you use a AI baton to conduct a Philharmonic Orchestra.<br>Oh and don't forget to play a tune on the musical staircase...which is basically a piano layed out on the staircase to make a tune
19;Fun and educational;Amazing experience for the whole family. We had so much fun and we learned a lot new stuff about the sound and the music. We spent more than 3 hours there. Highly recommend even without kids.
19;Interactive, educating, children love it;Great time here! Lots of rooms... Many interactive displays. Children enjoyed it a lot. The exhibition was both fun and educating. One can easily spend a couple of hours here. We did one hour just before closing at 10 PM - no queues.
19;House of music;It was an amazing experience. The best museum for music lovers. The museum is interactive for children and for adults.
19;Great interactive museum;Lovely museum with lost of interactive elements - you can try conducting a choir, you can make your own piece of music as a group, you will test your ears or can even play the piano by running up and down the stairs. Recommended for both adults and children.
19;Explore music with kids;Super nice things you can do here with your kids. I liked every floor exhibition. Kids loved the piano stairs and some 3d activity.
19;Nice music museum;Very nice museum especially for kids as there are some parts which are hands one. My son really liked it. If you visit the place after 8pm you pay half price worth a visit
19;Info and interactions👍;Visited the museum with my 4 year old son and partner. Went after 8pm and paid half the ticket price for entry. The place is entertaining and there are alot of things to interact to and have fun apart from knowledge<br> Can also be orchestra conductor for a few minutes. Definately worth a visit.
20;St.Charles  silence and meditation;On the right side of the boulevard du Moulin the very clean church St.Charles. You have to take some steps up but it gives a bref result.<br>Nineteen stained glass windows light the nave. The gilded chandeliers come from the armory of the Prince's Palace ,now is the Throne room. Must see,this elegance ,admirably. Admission free. Please let the silence be in you and  take a time for meditation.
20;Beautiful in and out.;The exterior has beautiful design and statues. The interior has a very feel of distinction from entrance to alter.
20;Wonderful English Mass;We went to the English mass and it was delightfully wonderful.  It was very well attended with many Filipinos, ex-pats as well as english speaking catholics, visitors and locals.  The priest happened to be from my home town of Washington, DC and doing a stint in Monte Carlo.  The Mass was really nice and the music was outstanding with a very nice choir.
20;Very elegant;This elegant edifice is in the French Renaissance style ,with the bell tower rising very high .It was inaugurated in 1883.<br>Nineteen stained glass windows light the nave.<br>The gilded chandeliers come from the armory of the Prince's<br>Palace ,now is the Throne room.<br>Must see,this elegance ,admirably.<br>Admission free.
20;Beautiful;This church just springs you as you are walking along this shopping street , loads of history behind it and absolutely stunning especially at night when it’s all lit up
20;Enlightening;I visit this church often including mass<br>has something special to it<br>simple, beautiful, peaceful<br>an excellent organ<br>worse a visit
20;Lovely parish church!;This is the most beautiful church in Monaco, after the Cathedral.  The history of the church is impressive and so is the architecture.  It is a pity that the Masses are quite difficult to understand as the clergy (Oblate Fathers) are not fluent in French.  There is an international congregation and at noon on a Sunday there is an English Mass which is very well attended but local foreign residents.  This Mass is understandable as the pastor is a native English speaker.
20;St. Charles;A very pretty church on the main route. Lit a candle. It is open all day to go inside. They have an English mass on Sundays at noon.
20;Blessed experience;This church is very beautiful and tranquil.  It was very cool and a great way to get away from the mayhem.
20;Princess Grace;Visited in June 2012 to see Princess Grace's grave.  Beautiful flowers laid out on her grave which is beside Prince Ranier's.  Found further away near the back of the church.
20;Beautiful Church to see;Well worth the time to visit this church. Just like any church in Europe you'll find a lot of similarity, but there are special differences about them. This one was serene and comforting.
20;Respectful and peaceful;A lovely church, well organised so that one can sit and pray or wander around.  Went in late September so there was no mad crowds wanting to see Princess Grace's grave.  Only for the picture you would really walk past it.  Very glad that I experienced it though.
21;Great exhibition but the worst ticket management ever !;Great exhibition! A wonderful setting and well worth visiting.<br>It’s a pity that they offer online tickets that are a farce. <br>When you arrive at the museum you need to queue in line to get a band on your wrist! This is just a joke! <br>Also the staff where not amused with our disbelief in this complicated and useless system.<br>What a shame.
21;Big and beautiful museums with lots of interesting exhibitions.;It was a big and beautiful museum with a big museum shop full of interesting stuff.  There is also a beautiful restaurant there.<br><br>There are a lot of interesting and beautiful exhibits.  Highly recommended.
21;Big museum, small (but nice) collection, oddly understaffed;The MAK is Vienna's museum for design, and it has an outstanding collection of one particular area: fin-de-siecle Vienna. If you're into the design and aesthetic of Jugendstil and early Expressionist decorative arts and design, this is a must see. For a broader history of decorative arts you should go to the furniture museum (Hofmobiliendepot Möbel Museum). For key paintings of fin-de-siecle Vienna, you should go to the Belvedere Museum (Upper Belvedere).<br><br>There are some problems with the museum. First of all, it's a huge building, and there's surprisingly little in it. You would think they would or could fill it with famous art. Second, there's hardly anyone working there. Need to find the bathroom? There's no one to ask. I had to go back to the ticket-taker in the lobby to ask. Need help in the gift shop? None of the employees seem to care. There was a long line to speak with one staff member, while the others tidied the shelves and did busywork. <br><br>Es gibt einige Probleme mit dem Museum. 1. Es ist ein riesiges Gebäude und es ist überraschend wenig darin. Sie würden denken, sie würden oder könnten es mit berühmter Kunst füllen. 2. Dort arbeitet kaum jemand. Brauchen Sie das WC zu finden? Es gibt niemanden zu fragen. Ich musste zurück zum Ticketschalter in der Lobby, um mich zu erkundigen. Brauchen Sie Hilfe im Museumsshop? Keiner der Mitarbeiter scheint sich darum zu kümmern. Es gab eine lange Schlange, um mit einer Mitarbeiterin zu sprechen, während die anderen die Regale umgeordneten. <br><br>(I translated that last part in German in case someone from the museum team should read these reviews.)<br><br>So, in sum, if you want to see design articles from Vienna's heyday around 1900, it's a great place, but don't expect too much of the place.
21;Completely unhelpful staff + a very small, very focused, but exhibition;When I was in the museum, I wanted to eat a snack so I went to the museum cafe. Although the restaurant was almost empty, no one came to ask for my order. So my family and I left. Then, in the museum shop, I wanted to buy an expensive gift, but no one assisted me. I couldn't get anyone to help me with selection, and then I couldn't get anyone to ring me up at the register. <br><br>The Germans have a word for such bad service: Servicewüste ("customer service desert").  I was shocked that a famous museum and tourist destination seems not to care about its visitors, especially when they want to spend more money.<br><br>(By the way, the permanent exhibition of the museum is beautiful, but very small and focused almost entirely on Vienna around the year 1900. And the entrance fee is quite expensive: €15.)
21;Not the most welcoming museum…..;The building is lovely but seems rather empty and sparsely furnished with exhibits in places. Not the friendliest museum we visited in Vienna, we were scolded by one if the many museum staff for setting off an alarm on a chair exhibit, we didn’t see any instructions to tell us where we were allowed to walk (or not!), this appeared to be a frequent occurrence as we heard it going off after us several times, perhaps better signage is required? Then in the next room with Biedermeier furniture I tripped over a large glass plate underneath each room setting which I hadn’t seen and was told off again. I felt like a naughty schoolgirl! <br>One staff member followed us around a whole room when there was no one else in it, a bit intimidating to say the least, perhaps he thought we were casing the place?! <br>Best bit of the visit was the excellent cafe, we were warmly welcomed, seated and fed and the apple and blue cheese soup was delicious, it’s a lovely setting too. The museum shop has some really good quirky gifts too and is worth a visit on its own.
21;Wouldn’t be rushing back;A somewhat dull and rambling museum. Some interesting exhibits from the arts and craft era but overall the museum lacked coherence. A disappointing experience considering the fantastic building.
21;OK museum if you are bored;Quite interesting museum but nothing really super-impressive. Worthy to visit, but never consider going to the nearby cafe! No way!<br><br>The museum itself was OK, I can’t really add something on top of it
21;Great place;Just walking by it, have been many times and is always worth a visit, this time i did not as you gave to have a mask all time due to covid and looked a bit crowded. Modrran art and more. Tickets are 14 euros.
21;Mixed feelings;Design lab was very interesting, however, on the upper two floors there was nothing special to be seen apart from lots of carpets, and chairs, and more chairs, and a bit more chairs.
21;The building is beatiful;I was there with my brother. The building is designed nice and it has many rooms. But I am not fan of modern art. Most of the works are modern.
22;good but not the best;very interesting architecture and a lot of colour but I think that this is not something that you must see in Vienna, there are a lot of more interesting things.
22;A Riot of Colour in Countless Media;After visiting the Hundertwasserhaus, which can be viewed only from outside, we headed for the museum, strangely not named after him but dedicated to his work.<br><br>What a body of work too – mainly paintings here but also fascinating insights into all the other media in which he worked, from redesigning a church to stamps, graphics, car number plates, even a poster for the Munich Olympics. <br><br>The thread running through it all was his use of vibrant colours in everything. <br><br>Magnificent!
22;Mixed experience at Hunderwasser Museum;Interesting architecture, fascinating environmental exhibit, but paintings were not to our taste and floors were not disabled-friendly.
22;Good food but expensive;We visited the cafe. Great food (except vegetarian option) and expensive. Best chips I’ve tasted in a long time and husband said schnitzel was mwah! Good wine too.
22;Undulating floors lead to an amazing find!;Here we found the most amazing artist ,Hunderwasser- which was a joy after such a long walk to find it (Its not really easy to find ) the quirky cafe there too was great fun and the staff were most friendly . There is lift access if you need it - the staff were most helpful.Beware the floors  beneath you undulate and if you are using crutches of sticks can un nerve you a little.
22;Interesting;This is a very interesting house located in the outskirts of Vienna.  The architecture is quite unique.
22;It's okay;Unusual buildings, but mostly a gift shop.   If you don't have much else to do, then it would be worth a trip, otherwise, you're not missing much.
22;Hunderwasser's paintings;We had already seen so much art that we were rather tired by the time we got here but we were so glad we did! Whether you know Hundertwasser or whether you don't this is the most charming museum in which to enjoy his amazing work. I've never seen so many of his gorgeous painting. The museum itself is also glorious even down to the loos, the shop and the cafe where the cakes were well up to other Viennese patisseries. This is an absolutely don't miss.
22;An interesting but quite expensive museum and a very rude lady at the lobby;The museum is very interesting and not tiring at all! <br>The negative part is that it  is much too expensive for its size - 11 euros for adults, comparing with much bigger museums such as Albertina museum (17,90 euro) or Kunsthistorisches Museum (18 euro)! In addition, the lady at the lobby was very rude with us. Finally,  although the ticket was not at a reasonable price there was no aircondition in a very hot day.
22;Beautiful Building, and exhibits.;We originally were interested in seeing the building, which is a must. the exhibits were very interesting and worth the visit by far. The cafe in the courtyard was also nice and beautiful
22;The man is a genius;Very rarely do you find a museum that inspires you as much, here you can see a small portion of a lifetime of work, as an architect he has major building works in lots of countries his art is amazing yet he has also chosen to live off the grid in rural NZ which is the inspiring aspect. Where with all the success he has chosen an off the grid simple life with nature but in doing so has influenced people of his second home with an amazing art gallery building in Whangerei NZ. <br>What a legend!  Walk 5 blocks down the road and see his apartment building and village shops.
22;Unexpected and recommended;Extremely interesting but I strongly recommend an audio guide to fully appreciate what you are seeing plus the background.<br>The collection is a nice counterbalance to the baroque and gold leaf.<br>After the visit, you look at the world in a different way.
22;Always a Pleasure;Love the Architecture. Love the Cafe.<br><br>So always visit irrespective of what is on show. Caught a Martin Parr Exhibition a few years back.<br><br>Thought When the Wind Blows was interesting, but a bit towards the "arty farty" school of
23;Great Experience!;Wonderful experience - saw La Fille Mal Gardee which was excellent.  Great atmosphere with lots of children being treated to the ballet by grandparents. Nice to see people dressing up for the occasion! Nb it starts at 7 pm not the usual 8 pm in England.
23;#MS (must see) Tosca Opera by Puccini it’s a dream!!!<br><br>Breathtaking, mesmerizing experience at Vienna State Opera! <br>Where The Spirit of unlimited beauty and positive vibes  takes you to the most unique places.
23;Watching the entire from a 40 inch tv screen was less than satisfying.;We arrived at the opera house at 7:02.  And was told it has started.   We would have to wait for a break.  We were not told we had to watch from a 42 inch screen in a highly lit room the entire first half of the play.   <br><br>While I would expect to have to wait until a break there were at least 4 occasions that could have seated us to enjoy the play.   Very upsetting as a patron !
23;Lovely Night;It was fantastic experience, the opera structure and the interior decoration are amazing. the music and concerts are well chosen, I attended the concert with my wife, it was  truly enjoyable night.
23;Magical;This is worth it to buy tickets to the box seats on the balconies. Great view and privacy. We were lucky there were only 3 of us in our box with excellent views.<br><br>I recommend that you arrive at least 45 minutes before the concert begins to line up for your seats. There is frantic allocation of seats and it can be a bit chaotic. However once you have the ticket you will be shown to your seat.<br><br>Sit back and enjoy Mozart’s all time hits!

24;Beautiful;One of the most iconic structures in Vienna is Palmenhaus Schönbrunn .<br>One of the largest greenhouses in the world ,opened in 1882 and opened by none other than Franz Joseph I,it's a great greenhouse to visit ,even if you're not into horticulture it's a wonderful building to view or like me and my twin brother Stephen who enjoyed beers in the cafe within the greenhouse,Palmenhaus was partly destroyed during the Second World War but rebuilt from 1948 till 1953 ,it's impressive in size ,111 metres long ,25 metres high and a staggering 45.000 glass tiles ,it's  a stunning greenhouse to view and well worth checking out if you're planning a holiday to Vienna and easy to locate in Schlosspark Schonbrunn.
24;Great setting for Brunch;This is a review for the Brasserie as we visited in Feb and the gardens are obviously not on show.  Highly recommend the Brasserie housed in the giant tropical greenhouse. Vienna being full of great Cafe's this one is a bit different. Great brunch food in a tranquil setting,  though still with a gentle buzz, next to the Butterfly house. Grand Palms everywhere. Fun.
24;Very Nice botanical garden in the center of the palace grounds;The Palm House in the center of the Schoenbrunn palace grounds is a very nice botanical garden and a must see for anyone who enjoys gardens.  There are three separate climate zones and each one is filled to the rafters with lovely plants and, overall, is very well maintained.<br><br>If you want a quiet cool place on enjoy during a summer visit to Vienna, this is the place for you.
24;There are Three Collections;The Palmenhaus Schoenbrunn is quite small compared to other botanical gardens I have visited, however, it still manages to contain three different collections of plants. It's worthwhile and interesting to see the diverse interests of the historic owners of the palace.
24;excellent place;this was a lovely place to visit a great place for photographers and me as a teenager of 13 found this place rather interesting as I have always been a nature seeker. it got open grass land will a lovely display of flowers in the centre you can go in the building and it was full of rather peculiar plants.
24;Place to hang out;Quite a nice place... a lovely butterfly house and restaurant where you can hang out and take in the gardens.
24;Very instagrammable!;Great way to spend a hot or a rainy day in Vienna. Very instagrammable with its huge rooms with various plants. Gets quite busy in the spring and summer, would recommed to go here as early as possible and not in the afternoon/close to closing time.
24;Unique and so pleasant to the eyes!;It’s super beautiful green house in the gardens of Schönbrunn Palace where you can enjoy different plants and flowers in three big sections! It has a 6 euro entrance (you can not book it online) but there are a few visitors so there is no queue. The climate is also varies depending on which section you are. I found it very cute  and . beautiful! It reminded my of some very vip garden of another era.
24;Beautiful;A nice warm stop out of the cold. The three sections are different temperatures. Very beautiful and there was a bride having some photos done there as it’s a nice setting. Quite a few seats around to sit down.<br>Toilets are clean and free.
24;Palmenhaus Schönbrunn a must;We visited the Palmenhaus Schönbrunn not in its best season, in January 5, 2019<br>We went there and visited as well the Schönbrunn zoo and Desert house, but Palmenhaus was our favorite. Amazing greenery while the winter lights were still on.<br>Although I can't help you with any name, all the plants and flowers have the names written, and the house is divided in different zones with different temperatures and ground and climate conditions.  It was very interesting and of course very beautiful.
24;Green house with history!;For those who loves plants it should be on the list to visit. Huge variety of plants nicely arranged under enormous glass roof. We enjoyed it a lot!
24;Palmenhaus focusing only german;No English in any of the signs, only German. Plants has scientific names in Latin. Lots of plants. Building is nice iron structure from late 19th century.
24;There are many finer places to dine;Went here with my wife and adult daughter. The place is pretty, I’ll give them that. Service? More like be rude and ignore.  The food was second rate. Schnitzel was dry, potato salad excellent. Veal burger ok. Get a second glass of wine? How can you when the waiter is non existent. And the prices are relatively high.  Oh, may I mention the cover charge on the bill? For items like napkins and tablecloths...or so the waiter told me.<br>Don’t bother with this one.
24;Nice experience, needs a little more information;The Palmhaus is nice, but it would have been nicer if there was more information on the plants, just the scientifc name of some plants is not enough.
25;Jonjon's Official review: "Literature Museum" (Vienna) LOCATION. The museum is at the mid-point between Stephansplatz and Karlsplatz. Expect a ten-minute walk. If you start off from Karlsplatz, step away from the parks and go north along Karntner Strasse. Hike your way into the pedestrian zone and past the church. Turn right into Johannesgasse and you’ll be there within a minute. <br><br>CROWD CONTROL CHECK. This is a lonely poor thing, and by far the most uncrowded attraction I can find in Central Vienna. Don’t underestimate its size – two floors of permanent showcases, throw another one in for changing exhibitions. Imagine what it’s like to stroll across videos screens and alleys of descriptions, artifacts, excerpts – only to meet no one else but two staffers along the way. <br><br>After buying your ticket you’ll be given an iPad “audio” guide (not a hiss ever comes out of it I’m not sure if that’s the right name). As you walk from checkpoint to checkpoint you have to literally touch the sticker at the back of your pad to the round icons on the wall and with the right orientation. An English translation will appear on the screen. Only those general introductory texts will be translated though, and only in the permanent galleries. <br><br>The gallery sets up Austria’s literary scenes by tracing them back to their Catholic and enlightenment roots. And then find yourself in an anthology of entropy gone wild, an ambitious journey that travels through the larger German-speaking world with a hint of its complex linguistic relationships with the Czech and its Prague authors and back into the wider German sprachraum and the apolitical tendencies of Austrian novels to be sprinkled with examples of how stories interact with the pop culture and… <br><br>A magnificent feat indeed. A little more hint of its relevance might just save the place.
25;Superb Journey Throughout Austrian Literature;For under 10€, two of us got to explore Austrian history that was seemlessly linked to notable literary figures. As a lover of literature, this museum provides enough knowledge to make you feel fulfilled and confident in your knowledge of Austrian literature. In fact, it urges you with a deep need to pick up a copy from one of those authors and journey into their world. It's a must see for anyone who loves literature!! GO NOW. GO TOMORROW. GO THIS WEEK. JUST GO.  Side note: if you're an English speaker, I advise paying for the tablet as it provides English translations for the German display text.
25;Language Barrier;As a writer, literature musuems are always interesting, and this is no exception. Interesting history of Austrian writing, I only wish more of the displays had translations or that I were fluent in German. Definitely not your typical tourist stop, but worth it for book bugs.
25;The most beautiful historic library in Vienna and possibly the world!;Housing Austria's best! A baroque state hall with a difference - frescoes, arches, marble statues etc. It took 3 years to build (1723-1726) with the ceilings completed 4 years later in 1730. It is currently used as a museum housing books and works by Prince Eugene of Savoy. Thourghly recommend it.
25;Imaginatively organized, rich introduction to modern Austrian literature.;This museum gives a very rich introduction into the modern literary history of Austria.  It is set in the building that formerly housed the state archive, where Franz Grillparzer, one of Austria's greatest writers, was director.  The permanent exhibit is housed on two floors where the old shelving of the archive was, and the exhibit is displayed in this (historically protected) shelving.  This presents all sorts of challenges in presentation, but these challenges are very imaginatively met and there is an almost overwhelming amount of information and artefacts on display, that should be catnip for those interested in Austrian writers, whether they be Arthur Schnitzler, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Karl Kraus, Heimito von Doderer, Hilde Spiel, Peter Handke, Thomas Bernhard etc., etc.  I have calculated two or three hours, but a really thorough visit would last much longer.  Excellent addition to Vienna's museum scene.
26;Democracy in Austria?!;Build in classic Greek style in 1870s and 1880s, the building stands out for its grand columns and brilliant marble.
26;Worth a Look;This beautiful building on Ringstrasse was under reconstruction and we could not enter.  It was scheduled to open in January of 2023.  However, it was certainly beautiful to see from outside and the splendid Pallas Athene Fountain is worth seeing in and of itself.  This 13-foot-high statue is adorned with a gilded helmet and lance, along with figures symbolizing the Rivers Danube, Inn, Elbe, and Moldau.
26;Stunning;Österreichisches Parlament ( Austrian Parliament ) is one of the most stunning buildings in Vienna ,high praise indeed when you consider the beautiful architecture that proliferates this most beautiful of city's.<br>The building was constructed between 1874-1883 and built in the Greek Revival style of architecture so pleasing on the eye from designs from architect Theophil Hansen ,it's one of the largest structure contained within the famous Ringstraße,the parliament building is primarily used for state occasions , the building looks amazing , the facade so beautiful ,the famous Athena Fountain ( Pallas Athene Brunnen ) at the forefront of this building is a wonderful set of sculptures and a fine looking and historic fountain worth viewing in it's own rite ,my twin brother Stephen and I were heading to he magnificent Rathuasplatz Christmas Market adjacent go the parliament building ,I took some photos before heading into the Christmas market for a warming mulled wine,if you're planning a holiday to Vienna it's a building I highly recommend you seek out ,it's easy to locate along Dr Karl Renner Ring.
26;Available for tours again after the reopening;While my visit happened during the open days, I would think that the spaces you could see there would still be representative for the tours starting next week or so (the rooms one could see were on the route of a parliament tour in 2011 as well).<br><br>After renovation most of the rooms seem to be a lot brighter, partly also thanks to new roof lights and cleaned overhead glass. The parliament is considered one of the big masterpieces along Vienna's Ringstrasse boulevard, built in a neo-classical style.
26;Opening January 2023!;The Austrian Parliament dominates Ringstrasse. It is one of the most characteristic examples of the classical Greek architectural renaissance. The building was designed by architect Theophil Hansen and completed in 1883. It has been home to  Austria's National and Federal Parliament since 1918. Don’t miss the exterior carvings depicting the granting of the Constitution by Franz Joseph I to the 17 peoples of Austria, along with numerous marble statues and reliefs.<br><br>Another highlight is the splendid Pallas Athene Fountain with its 13-foot-high statue adorned with a gilded helmet and lance, along with figures symbolizing the Rivers Danube, Inn, Elbe, and Moldau.  We could only ride by as it has been under reconstruction for over 5 years.  Due to open in January 2023.
26;Impressive;Very impressive exterior using classic Greek architecture, bronze statues and the Pallas Athene Fountain.located on the Ringstrasse so easy to find, a definite photo location
26;Almost impossible to enter;It is quite pretty from the outside, totally worth taking pictures of it. The bad part is that it is almost impossible to enter, on the internet it says that there are visits every hour, but when we went they told us that just some days. There is no way to check it on the internet, so it is very complicated.<br>It would be a good idea to sell the tickets online for the days and hours of the visit.<br><br>Also, they put a fence so you cannot come close to it to take pictures.
26;Another great building on the Ringstrasse;The Austrian Parliament Building is on the Ringstasse just down from the great Neo-Gothic Rathaus.  The Parliament is a Greek Revival that would look more at home in Washington DC.  However, it was designed in the 1880's to pay homage to the Greeks and their creation of democracy, including numerous statues of Greek philosophers.  Anyways is was appropriately here in 1918 where the Austrian government escaped the Hapsburgs' rule and became a republic after WWI.
26;the parliament;the main building was under renovation and we could not go in. from the outside the design and architecture was very Roman style. very impressive.
26;Very interesting;Found this by chance and it was one on the most interesting and informative things we did . The main parliament building is undergoing renovation so you see round where it is temporarily located  in the Hofburg complex . It is free to get in . While you see the two rooms used the reason we enjoyed it so much was finding out more about the history of both Austria and the parliament .
26;Greek Neoclassical;The Austrian parliament building is a the location where the two houses of the Austrian Parliament conduct their meetings. Much of the building is currently under cover due to renovations, but it's pretty obvious from what's visible that the building is in the Greek Neoclassical style. Hope to see more of it once the covers come off.
26;Recommended;We enjoyed this very informative tour. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and entertaining. We wish we can visit  the main building after the renovations.
26;Great tour very interesting;We went for the tour in the temporary parliament building. Really interesting and beautiful building
26;Very attractive building;Parliament building is very attractiive and historical.  Now it is undergoing major renovation work.  Parliament is one of the finest building in Vienna and a must to see.
27;The atmosphere, energy and history are incredible;The atmosphere, energy and history are incredible. Mozart really was a big musician, Freemason and with brilhant ideas and knowledge.
27;Great museum. Concert is a introductory to classical music. Music lovers just visit the museum is enough;The museum itself would have been 5 stars. Great explanation with the tour guide machine, so that you can visit the exhibition at your own pace, without have to follow an actual tour guide. Really gave a holistic perspective into Mozart’s life, works, and the life of people in his time. After the visit to the museum, I watched Amadeus the movie. I recommend you do the same: watching the movie before or after the museum visit, to get a complete experience into Mozart (the movie is partly fictional to exaggerate dramatic effects so some scenes are not factually true)<br><br>However, I deducted one star because of the concert. Deducting from the admission price, as a student, I paid 27€ for the Mozarthaus concert. The pianist did not seem to have practiced enough. The violin and the cello were beautiful and professional. As a piano player, I could not help but be particularly disappointed. The venue was average, and the repertoire was a bit cliché (they played pieces like Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, The Blue Danube, The Swan by Saint-Saëns, Arabesque by Debussy, etc.). I suppose this concert is designed for tourists who had no experience at all in classical music, since the cello player keeps explaining very basic classical music concepts. I have no problem in this at all, as they are doing a great job promoting classical music to the general public, and I applaud their effort. However it was not I wanted to see when I bought the ticket. Overall, I am a long-time classical music lover and I would have loved to spend the ticket money for a legit concert in Wiener Konzerthaus or other venues. So, if you dont know anything about Classical Music, this concert in Mozarthaus may not be a bad idea. If you are looking for a nice classical concert, I would suggest to look elsewhere.
27;Magical;String quartet played a 1 hour program of Mozart, Haydn, Schubert, Bach abd Beethoven.<br>Amazing acoustics and incredible musicians a small and intimate setting a real treat fir the soul
27;Maybe see once.;I was expecting a lot more from this visit. There was a lot of information about other musicians, I expected more information about mozart. Good to see, glad I did it but I wouldn't go again. Not worth the time or money.
27;Interesting for Mozart lovers;Exhibition about the life of Mozart in the house where he lived for about 3 years. Interesting and well done IF you really are interested in Mozart and have already knowledge about his life and times and his music, otherwise: don't go.
27;DON’T GO;THE WORST. It is so unfair that they open this house, in which Mozart lived only 3 years and that is totally reconstructed. I still don’t understand why is it recommended, price high, quality low. You will just see explanations about Mozart life, not more about its house.<br>Don’t lose your money!!!
27;Only if you want to know more about Mozart;It is a rather small museum and not a whole lot of exhibits, but we spent quite a bit of time listening to the audio guide to learn a bit more about Mozart's life in Vienna. This museum is really recommended if you are into Mozart.
27;Good visit to a house where Mozart once stayed;I took a daughter here, who knew nothing about Mozart. <br>Entry was straightforward. We took audio guides in English.<br>Audioguides were good, was nice to see everything in there. We took an hour over it, but could have taken up to 90 minutes. There is a fair amount of information.<br>I have read the other reviews, and they are right that there is a certain amount of guess work as no one is quite sure what any of the rooms were used for. But it's the city where Mozart spent a fair amount of time, and a house he actually lively in. Was informative.
27;Underwhelming;V central<br>Good condition <br>Was damaged badly In war so some a rebuild <br>No actual living space <br>Well worth a look<br>Nice shop too <br>Recommended
27;Great Tribute to The Greatest Composer!;We visited and were quite satisfied with the content. We went early enough and had the place to ourselves for a while. This is a tourist favorite, so I recommend you go as soon as it opens, so that you don’t have to rub elbows with others. If you are not a Mozart Fan perhaps this place is not for you. No suitable for children under 10.
27;Worth a Visit If You Are a Mozart Lover;This tour can be disappointing depending on your expectations. It is relatively cheap so you can't really go wrong. There is not a lot to see and much of the furniture is replica, but hey, Mozart lived here. It's cool to say you've been there.
27;Modern museum which dealt well with Mozart’s life;They had handicap access to the three floors which makes it easy for anyone to visit this multimedia museum. <br>We enjoyed not only learning more about the opera he composed in Vienna but his entire life. This included a look into his excessive gambling habits, his lavish lifestyle and expensive tastes.
27;Very good museum, I recommend.;It was good but some things about Mozart had not been told. Also they referred to a harpsichord as a piano🗿. I recommend going to this museum as it is interesting but its not perfect.
27;Felt unwelcome;This focuses on a small part of Mozart’s life, mostly while he lived in this building. It’s ok to pass an hour, but the exhibits could be better. Other than the lady on reception, the staff were rude and bored. One in particular shouted at me for having an umbrella, then got angry because I’d already been on other floors with it. She then proceeded to tell her colleagues how stupid the visitors were. It was quite aggressive and I was glad to leave.
27;Wow!!;If you are a music lover like me, this is the place you have to go!!!!!!<br>It has so many things to see and you will be amazed!!!
27;Skip it and go to a real museum;This is nothing but an empty apartment where they keep repeating that they don't know how Mozart actually used it.  This might have been the bedroom, this probably was a living room - uccck!<br>The exhibit photos seem to have everyone except Mozart.<br>The audio tour is interesting but nothing that you need to go here for....<br>Check out any online tour it would be better.<br>So many wonderful museums to see in Vienna - we were sorry we waisted our time here.
28;Interesting but limited;Interesting museum, but other than the WWI section there is a lack of English language signage, so if you're a German speaker this would get a higher rating, but since this is the English tripadvisor site, it's important to note this.<br>In addition, there are some puzzling historic gaps. in the extensive WWI section thee is almost zero mention of the USA entering the war.  Regardless of how one feels about this, it was an important step which lead directly to the war's conclusion.<br>So overall average.
28;Good Collection But Needs Museum-Provided Audio Guides;There are very few English descriptions, so you'll need to download an app for an audio guide if you don't speak German. In the time it took to download the app and then to download the two hour tour, I was halfway through the museum. Granted I only understood maybe 20% of what anything was, but I wanted to do something while I was waiting.<br><br>I ran into a lady working there. Apparently "the law" of the museum is that all bags need to be carried on a person's chest. This is fine. The lady who told me was initially nice about it and I immediately shifted my bag to my front and said that it wasn't a problem and I would have done it if I'd been told to before.<br><br>As I was walking away she said that it was the law of the museum. Lady, I'm already walking away. What was the purpose of telling me that?<br><br>Either way, I give it three stars for the collection, which is substantial. If you're an English-Speaker or someone that speaks any language other than German, I'd recommend pre-downloading the app and tour, pre-charge your phone because it will take a while, and beware the chatty lady trying to justify the rules even when you're now abiding by them.
28;Husbands trip;We travelled by train from gasometer and then walked 15 mins was fairly easy to find. A lovely gentleman found storage for our cases as we were travelling home that day.<br>We could not get audio headsets due to covid which is weird as it long since finished! We didn’t try the phone app as we arnt that good we used the leaflets in the rooms with mixed success. <br>My husband ex military loved it and I found enough to interest me but feel the hand sets would hav been most helpful for me.<br>I feel seats near the TVs would have been useful as the museum is huge. We stoped 1/2 way round for drinks a rest abd look in the shop which was reasonably priced mostly.
28;the best military museun ever;this is the oldest and most comprehensive museum of military history in Europe reporting very well on wars of Austro-Hungarian empire as well as its enemies. Full scale models and some old equipment from first world war and before was fascinating. well worth the visit.
28;Big improvement;This was my second visit to the museum and this time with the family. Lots of improvements since my last visit more than ten years ago, with better organization of the exhibits from the wars in the 16th until the 20th century. Quite detailed information on the exhibits and this is a really good military museum to visit.
28;Must visit;We visited the museum with our children during a medieval Xmas market.Incredible experience for us  and . children.We wore knight armor,listened to medieval music etc. Unbelievable experience,total worth it!
28;More than traditional military history -- and an amazing World War I exhibit;This museum is a hidden gem. First of all: It's not just a regular military history museum. Yes, there are tons of suits of armor, arms, and tanks. But the most significant exhibition at the museum is the World War I exhibit, and it does an excellent job of telling the story of the immediate origins of the war (the assassination in Sarajevo) and the course of the war from an Austrian perspective. It explains the story of the war as experienced by many ordinary Austrians. In that way, it's a great complement to the Imperial War Museum in London and the National WWI Museum in Kansas City, for example. <br><br>I went with a large group, and the others weren't interested in the Austro-Turkish Wars or the War of Austrian Succession, but everyone was fascinated by the large, detailed, and varied World War I exhibit.  And, of course, the centerpiece of the exhibit is the actual car that Archduke Franz Ferdinand was riding in when he was shot, the uniform that he wore, and the pistols used by the conspirators.  <br><br>Plus, admission to the museum is only 7 Euros (free for under 19s) -- a bargain compared to most museums in Vienna.
28;Nice place, helpful staff;If your serving military you get in for free regardless of what country which was a good plus. Nice layout, however it would be nice if they had post ww2 exhibits even post 9/11
28;A treasure trove of history;Two large floors of Austrian military history, a must for history buffs. An added bonus when we visited was the tank hall, which is only open on weekends, with over 30 military tanks on display.
28;Essential for those interested in history;This is without doubt the best war museum I’ve ever been to. I spent several hours inside this beautiful building. There are artefacts dating back to the medieval period, through to the 19th century, both world wars and beyond. The most fascinating exhibits were the uniform Franz Ferdinand was wearing during the assassination, as well as the car
28;Go for minutes, stay for hours;What a building for a museum. The building on its own is worth a viewing. Once inside the fun really begins. The layout was perfect and the collection is vast and informative. One could spend hours there and never move much. I have visited many many military history museums throughout the world and this is one of the most impressive. The tours for school children wasn’t invasive or too distracting. At €7 this museum is so much value for money and a definite must see.
28;Beautiful building, interesting museum;Located 10 minutes by walk from the central train station, parking is also available. The building externally is very particular and It Is part of the arsenal complex. The museum is well structured with focus on austrian wars and there is the famous car in which the murder gave begin to the 1st world war. There is a pavillon apart dedicated to war tanks open only on weekends until 16 and to reach it you have to walk along the street on the left side of the museum for 10 minutes. Ticket is 7 € for adults.
28;One Highlight But Too Specialist;We visited this Military-themed museum because it was close to the Belvedere art galleries and it looked like an interesting building.  It also had a decent little cafe-restaurant just inside the Moorish gatehouse, with a friendly and efficient young waitress. To be honest, the contents of the museum itself are only really of interest to those who love military history, especially military history specific to central Europe.  The Sarajevo exhibit is impressive, displaying the motor car Arch Duke Ferdinand and his wife were assassinated in, which sparked the First World War - they also display the arch duke's tunic showing the bullet hole that killed him when he was shot in the neck (a bit morbid, but, let's face it, that's what armed conflict is like). The museum does what it does very well, but this is for military aficionados and specialists more than the casual tourist, I think.
28;Great value, with some must see artifacts.;Within a very impressive building, the museum holds a large collection telling the story of Austria's military history from 1789 through to the end of WWII.<br><br>Price of admission was only €7 for an adult, with concessions available, but this price was worth it to see the Sarajevo room alone. Artifacts from the event that changed the world, a must see for anyone interested in 1900's European history.<br><br>So much to see so leave a few hours to get around, but well worth it!
28;Amazing Building, Amazing History;This historic museum has a little bit of everything for anyone with an interest in European military history and the building is worth a visit in and of itself. The interior is stunning. There is an interesting assortment of vehicles, uniforms, weapons, and maps across centuries of Austrian military history. One could spend hours in just the Napoleonic era if they were so inclined. I most appreciated the World War I and World War II exhibits. The Nazi history was covered honestly and faithfully. And a highlight of the museum for me was the exhibits surrounding the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, including the actual vehicle he was riding in at the time.
28;Not bad, worth a visit;While we weren’t wowed by this museum, it’s still worth a visit. Vienna doesn’t have the museums of Moscow, Berlin or Paris, so I think this is pretty much the top choice for military/history buffs visiting Vienna. It covers Austria’s history from the 1700s or so until World War 2.<br><br>Some items to note:<br>-
29;Very interesting;Lovely to have a tour without the crowds which enabled one to appreciate its beauty.  The hand held guided talk was very good
29;Poor information, a lot of moneys;We had a tour in this place . Information was provided poorly. We were informed that we have to pay top price to visit palace and gardens, but access to gardens was free. We also were informed that tour in English language starts in 1.5 hour, we’re we waited and wasted, because tour  could be started anytime, because it actually provided by electronic hearing devices.
29;Amazingly beautiful!;Amazingly beautiful palace, worth the money you pay. Stunning, magnificent, truly royal. We got audioguide in Ukrainian language which is quite rare to find.<br><br>The only thing is: it is forbidden to make photos in the palace ( so, of course, we have not), but many people do and nobody cares. The same with smoking in the gardens. I just do not understand why to forbid things if they do not have enough staff to control that these rules are obeyed to,  It would be fair thast either nobody gets photos or everybody does.
29;And amazing experience, but the ticketing is confusing;The palace and gardens are truly remarkable. It is an amazing setting and lovely to explore. The ticketing system is confusing and haphazard. Surely it could be simplified.
29;Audio guide included in the ticket price;Took the Grand Tour of Schönbrunn Palace in early March 2023. An audio guide is included in the ticket price. Ornate interiors. No photographs allowed. After the tour, I strolled through Schönbrunn Palace Park. It was a cold, cloudy day with light rain. No garden or water features during the winter.
29;10/10;Got the grand tour as part of the Vienna flexi pass. When we went to get tickets (prepaid with the pass) they said we couldn't enter for two hours because it was busy that day. Minor inconvenience we returned at our designated time and it was worth the wait. We were given audio guides in English which was helpful. Top tip: the gardens are free to enter and walk around and are very large so if you have to wait for your tour time I'd highly recommend walking through the gardens. We went when the weather was a bit cold and very rainy but it was still beautiful. Tip: no backpacks allowed and there was a long queue for the cloakroom so either don't bring a rucksack or get there early and expect to have to wait a while.
29;Good but not great;We held a lot of hope for visiting this beautiful palace, but truth be told I don’t think it lived up to the hype. It was easy to get to on the metro from the centre of town, and I expect the gardens would be lovely to walk around for free in the summer. But in the winter, the gardens were quite bleak and the Christmas market wasn’t as good as others in town, so all that was left was the tour of the palace. We did the imperial tour (the shorter one) and from arriving at the main gate to doing the tour, and all there was to see and hear in the audioguide, only took us about an hour. We stayed a bit longer to look round the Christmas market and have some lunch, but it felt like quite a short visit to say you have to travel out of the centre for it. The palace itself was incredibly busy, so it felt more like a slow moving queue the whole way around. It was possible to visit with our baby in his buggy, but we were asked to carry it up the stairs as the wait for the lift was very long with just disabled people. This was fine for us, but may be a struggle for others with bigger prams. It was absolutely worth booking ahead though, as the ticket office queue when we arrived at 11.30 was massive. By 2pm when we were feeding our baby in the cafe by the ticket desk there was no queue at all and there were still tour times available, so if you’re going to walk-up make sure it’s at the end of the day. Mentioning food/drink, the cafe by the ticket office was not very good or not friendly so I would recommend avoiding it. The lunch we had at Cafe Residentz however was nice, so worth possibly waiting for a table there if you’re staying for food or drink.
29;Beautiful, here’s a few tips;This place is amazing but here are a few tips.  Even with Vienna pass you need to go to the ticket booth prior to entry to exchange for a paper ticket by time.  Go early because you may have a long wait prior to entry. We went on a rainy day with light crowds and had to wait 1 hour and 45 minutes.  There  are many other attractions to see on the grounds while you wait.  The strudel show was fun, go to the cafe in between the ticket booth and main entrance to the exhibit.  You can not take pictures inside.  The audio tour was great.
29;Our number one site to visit in Vienna. We spent 6 hours there and found it to be very worthwhile and enjoyable for the whole fa;3 generations visited this magnificent palace. In addition to myself my daughter and her husband were their 11 and 8 year old sons. <br>My complaint was the difficulty finding some of the things. The maps did not show where the maze was and the children wanted to see that first. We finally resorted to Google directions. You go in the back of the palace and walk towards the giant fountain. Partway there on your right between 2 statues is a recess with a sign that says maze labyrinth. The family enjoyed it although some areas had big puddles from the rain. There is also a children's playground that they both enjoyed and rest rooms.<br>The palace was magnificent.  Please be advised no backpacks or umbrellas are allowed on the tour, but there is a place to check them. We bought complete tickets but the strudel making closes admission 30 minutes before the final presentation which we missed by a few minutes.<br>This zoo has pandas. The best place to eat at the palace is an 18th century building in the center of the zoo that was a breakfast site for the royal family. You can get real meals there and the food was very good. The prices are better than the other restaurants and you can sit inside. It says they have wifi, but we were unable to get wifi the day we visited. <br>We were disappointed the books they had in the gift shop did not have the pictures we wanted to purchase and another tourist made the same comment in disappointment. <br>We purchased 2 books of photos when we visited the palacevin Madrid that we have shared with a lot of people and expected the same kind of publication. <br>The full tour was well worth the money and we recommend visitors buy tickets that cover everything<br> <br>
29;Huge Palace;Schonbrunn Palace is a vast building surrounded by gardens with varying uses. The entry fee for a tour of the state rooms was 20 euro which entitles you to an audio device or a booklet (but not both). The tour is limited to several rooms which give a feel for the palace as a whole. Unless you are really into its history a long guided tour could be exhausting. Interior photography is not permitted.<br>The palace grounds are free to visit in most places and the Gloriette Hill provides a magnificent view of the palace and Vienna. It also has a nice little restaurant which is worth dropping in.<br>The palace is next to the train station. It was surprising how packed the palace was for a weekday. It could be a nightmare at busy times.
29;Quite impressive;Schonbrunn is absolutely massive, you have to book a time slot for the grand tour. I think it depends on previous experience but although the ceilings are quite impressive the rooms are quite sparse with mainly tables and chairs set up as sitting rooms. I'm glad we visited but I'm not sure I would go again.
29;Easter market 2023 on grounds of Palace;Easter market was so charming. It’s in the grounds of the palace. Foods available and a manual merry-go-round. Sadly we got there as they were closing , but it’s really cute and well manned
29;Dress as a princess !;Fantastic place - plan and book your visit in advance - the grand tour was spectacular and in the children’s museum you get to dress up as princes and princesses ! This entertained my 10  and . 13 year olds for at least 1.5 hours ! The maze was also a fun family competition !
29;Imperial extravaganza;Pay attention now : if you have a Vienna pass you need to walk into the building where the hop on bus stops, you will get a ticket with a time on it. Don’t go into the palace without it, you won’t get in and have to go back. We did the Imperial audio tour, very interesting. Gardens are free, huge and amazing, you can also go up the Gloriette with your Vienna pass for amazing views. We had lunch at Cafe Landtmann in the grounds, finished off a great trip.
