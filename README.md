### Abstract

When traveling to an unfamiliar country for holidays, tourists often rely on guidebooks, travel websites,
or recommendation systems to plan their daily itineraries and explore popular points of interest(POIs).
However, these approaches may lack optimization in terms of time feasibility, localities, and user preferences.
In this paper, we propose the SBTRec algorithm: a BERT-based Trajectory Recommendation with sentiment analysis,
for recommending personalized sequences of \POIs~as itineraries.
    
Considering the locations, sightseeing, and travel time between consecutive POIs, our approach incorporates
individual user preferences through the utilization of historical data.
The key contributions of this work include analyzing users' check-ins and uploaded photos to understand the
relationship between POI~visits and distance.
We introduce SBTRec, which encompasses `sentiment analysis' to improve recommendation accuracy by understanding
users' preferences and satisfaction levels from reviews and comments about different {\POIs}.
    
Our proposed algorithms are evaluated against other sequence prediction methods using datasets from 8 cities.
The results demonstrate that SBTRec achieves an average {\F}~score of 61.45\%, outperforming baseline algorithms.
The paper further discusses the flexibility of the SBTRec algorithm, its ability to adapt to different scenarios and cities without modification, and its potential for extension by incorporating additional information for more reliable predictions.
Overall, SBTRec provides personalized and relevant POI recommendations, enhancing tourists' overall trip experiences.
Future work includes fine-tuning personalized embeddings for users with missing demographic information to further enhance prediction accuracy.
